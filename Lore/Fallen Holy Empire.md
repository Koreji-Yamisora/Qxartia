# The Fallen Holy Empire
_"The Church That Rewrote History"_

## Overview

The Fallen Holy Empire was once the dominant religious and political power across all three continents of [[Qxartia]]. For centuries, it controlled what people believed, what history was recorded, and what truths were forbidden.

It has since **collapsed** — but its influence persists in doctrine, prejudice, and buried secrets.

---

## What They Taught

The Empire's core doctrine:

| Teaching | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| [[Selamonius\|God]] is eternal and alone | Selamonius was one of [[The Pantheon]], a second-generation god |
| God created everything | The Pantheon created the planes together |
| The Pantheon never existed | The Pantheon did exist — the Empire erased them |
| The Feywild is corruption | [[The Feywild]] was created by a Pantheon god |
| The Abyss is divine punishment | [[The Abyss]] is an elemental realm, not an afterlife |
| Humans are the chosen race | No evidence supports this |
| Questioning is blasphemy | Convenient for those in power |

> ⚠️ *The Empire did not merely suppress truth — they manufactured an entire false history, so thorough that most people believe it without question.*

## History of the Empire

### The Founding (Unknown Date)
After [[The Severing]], as the planes restructured and the gods fell silent, a group of human clerics in [[Zytharkraen]] claimed to receive visions from the one remaining god. They called her simply "God" — later scholars identified her as [[Selamonius]].

These clerics formed the **Holy Order of the Eternal Light**, which would become the Empire.

### The Expansion (Centuries)
The Order spread across all three continents:

| Continent | Method of Expansion |
|-----------|-------------------|
| [[Zytharkraen]] | Missionary work, political marriage, economic control |
| [[Vornesthal]] | Crusades against the "godless" Deep-Dwellers |
| [[Kthrimvey]] | Slower — the forests resisted, but trade brought doctrine |

### The Consolidation
At its height, the Empire controlled:
- All major temples and religious sites
- Education — deciding what knowledge was permitted
- History — rewriting records, burning forbidden texts
- Burial rites — controlling access to the afterlife (or so they claimed)

### The Inquisition
The Empire created the **Inquisition of Sacred Memory** to:
- Hunt scholars who researched [[The Pantheon]]
- Destroy texts mentioning gods other than Selamonius
- Erase the names of the Pantheon from all records
- Punish "heretics" who questioned doctrine

Many texts about the Forgotten Ones and the Pantheon were lost forever during this period.

## The Fall

The Fallen Holy Empire collapsed approximately **200 years ago** (dates vary by region). The causes were multiple:

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **[[Entropy]] acceleration** | As decay spread, the Empire could not explain why God did not intervene |
| **Internal corruption** | High priests accumulated wealth while the faithful suffered |
| **The Silence** | Despite all their power, no miracles came — [[Selamonius]] never answered |
| **Discovery of forbidden texts** | The Lithic Tablets, Canopy Scrolls, and fragments of the Book of Forgotten Names surfaced |
| **Popular uprising** | When people realized the lies, they burned the churches |
| **[[Invasion]] pressure** | Realm-feeders didn't care about doctrine — they consumed priests and peasants alike |

The Empire fragmented. Some regions retain Imperial doctrine; others have rejected it entirely.

## What Remains

### Believers
Many common folk still believe Imperial doctrine — it's all they've ever known:
- God is one, eternal, and alone
- The other planes are dangerous or evil
- Tieflings are damned; elves are corrupted
- Questioning leads to damnation

### The Remnant Church
In some regions, a **Remnant Church** maintains Imperial practices, claiming the Empire fell because of sin, not falsehood. They await God's return.

### The Inquisition (Reformed)
Small cells of Inquisitors still exist, hunting "heretics" who spread the true history. They operate in secret.

### The Scars
- Many temples remain — some converted, some ruins
- Libraries still have gaps where books were burned
- Family names associated with the Inquisition carry shame
- Racial prejudice (against tieflings, elves) persists

## The Hidden Truth

The Empire knew more than they admitted:

| Secret | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| They knew The Pantheon existed | Internal documents reference "the old gods" as real threats |
| They may have communicated with Selamonius — once | Ancient records suggest early contact, then silence |
| They deliberately engineered [[The Celestial]]'s inaccessibility | Some theorize they wanted to prevent mortals reaching other gods |
| The Inquisition found powerful artifacts | Relics of the Pantheon, now hidden in secret vaults |

> 🌑 *"The Empire did not fall because they failed to find God. They fell because they found her — and she had nothing to say."*
> — Heretical scholar, executed 180 years ago

## Key Figures (Historical)

| Figure | Role |
|--------|------|
| **The First Pontiff** (name lost) | Founder of the Holy Order |
| **Saint Aldrath the Blind** | Created the doctrine of the Eternal Light |
| **Grand Inquisitor Morwen** | Oversaw the greatest book burnings |
| **Cardinal Thessaly** | Last leader before the Fall — fate unknown |

## Locations

| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **The Eternal Basilica** | Former seat of power in [[Zytharkraen]] — now a ruin or museum |
| **The Archive Vaults** | Hidden repositories of forbidden knowledge — location unknown |
