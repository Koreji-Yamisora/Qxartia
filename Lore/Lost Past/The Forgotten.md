## What They Are

The Forgotten are beings who have **lost their identity to [[Entropy]]** — not dead, but no longer themselves. They exist in the liminal space between being and unbeing, wandering without purpose or memory.

Some were once people. Some were once creatures. Some, the oldest tales whisper, were once gods.

## How One Becomes Forgotten

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Prolonged Miasma Exposure** | Breathing deep [[Miasma]] for too long erodes the self |
| **The Hollow Marshes** | Those who wander into [[Zytharkraen]]'s southern marshes sometimes forget how to leave — and then forget why they came |
| **Unburdening Gone Wrong** | In [[Kthrimvey]], giving too many memories to the trees may leave nothing behind |
| **Natural Entropy** | Some simply... fade. Over centuries, without anyone to remember them |

## What They Look Like

The Forgotten are not ghosts. They have bodies. But:
- Their features are **indistinct**, as if seen through fog
- They do not respond to their old names
- They repeat actions without knowing why
- Some wander; some stand still for years

---

## Are They Dangerous?

Not usually. The Forgotten are not hostile — they have forgotten how to want anything, including harm.

But proximity to them is unsettling. Travelers report:
- Difficulty remembering their own names afterward
- Dreams of lives they never lived
- A creeping sense of *losing edges*

> *"Stay too long near a Forgotten, and you'll start to wonder which of you is real."*

## Can They Be Saved?

Unknown. Some cultures believe that if you speak a Forgotten's true name — a name they themselves have lost — they will remember themselves.

No one has ever proven this works.
