## What Common Folk Know

Most people do not call her "Selamonius." Most people simply call her **God**.

The name "Selamonius" is old, half-forgotten, spoken only in ancient texts and by scholars who dig too deep. To the common folk of [[Qxartia]], there is only one divine being — eternal, uncreated, alone — and the name doesn't matter. Only the power does.

> *"God made the world. God made us. God watches. That's all we need to know."*
> — Common prayer across the three continents

## What the Scriptures Say

> *What follows is pieced together from scattered scriptures, oral traditions, and artifacts found across the three continents. No single account agrees with another. Truth, like memory, has eroded.*

The older texts — those that survived the [[Fallen Holy Empire]]'s purges — tell a different story.

## From the Forbidden Texts

> *From the [[Book of Forgotten Names]], recovered fragment:*
>
> *"And there came one who walked among the stars — not of light, but* beyond *it. A presence that cast no shadow, for shadows had not yet been invented. The [[The Drifting Ones|Drifting Ones]] called it* The Hand That Closes*."*

> *From the Lithic Tablets of [[Vornesthal]]:*
>
> *"Selamonius did not ask. Selamonius did not explain. Selamonius simply* shaped*. And what was shaped could never return to what it was."*

> *From the Canopy Scrolls of [[Kthrimvey]]:*
>
> *"The Hand came with edges, with endings, with weight. It took what drifted and made it* stay*."*

## The Divine Hierarchy

Selamonius is **the last** of [[The Pantheon]] — the second generation of gods:

| Generation | Name | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| 1st | [[The Forgotten Ones]] | Faded — exist only as fragments ([[The Drifting Ones]]) |
| 2nd | [[The Pantheon]] | Erased — all dead or vanished except Selamonius |
| 3rd | **Selamonius** | The last — still revered as "God" |

> ⚠️ *This hierarchy is forbidden knowledge. The [[Fallen Holy Empire]] teaches that God is eternal and uncreated — no predecessors, no siblings, no equals.*

## Interpretations Across Cultures

Different cultures understand Selamonius differently:

| Culture | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Zytharkraen** | A creator-god, benevolent but distant — gave the land its breath |
| **Vornesthal** | A force of cosmic necessity — neither kind nor cruel, simply *inevitable* |
| **K'thrimvey** | A prison-maker — one who trapped free beings in form and ending |

## The Shaping

According to the oldest accounts, Selamonius took three of [[The Drifting Ones]] and pressed them into matter:

- **One who breathed** → [[Zytharkraen]]
- **One who endured** → [[Vornesthal]]
- **One who dreamed** → [[Kthrimvey]]

Each remembers nothing of what it was. Each is slowly forgetting what it became.

## What Became of Selamonius?

No scripture records what happened after the shaping. Some theories:

- The Hand **withdrew**, her work complete
- She still walks among the stars, shaping other worlds
- The act of shaping **changed the shaper** — Selamonius became something else

> *From the Requiem of Still Things:*
>
> *"The Hand that shapes is also shaped. The one who gives endings cannot escape ending. Somewhere, in the space between stars, something that was once Selamonius is forgetting what it did — and why."*
