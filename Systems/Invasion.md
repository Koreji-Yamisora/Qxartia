# Invasion
_"What Comes Through the Cracks"_

> Entities exploiting [[Qxartia]]'s weakened defenses · See also: [[Entropy]] · [[The Severing]] · [[The Elemental Chaos]]

---

## Realm-Feeders

Entities that **consume structured magic**. They attack:
- Ley lines
- Sanctums
- World anchors

---

## Pattern Parasites

Entities that **inhabit magical systems**:
- Possess enchantments
- Rewrite spell logic
- Turn defensive wards into conduits

---

## Why Now?

Since [[The Severing]], the barriers between planes have never fully healed. [[Entropy]] weakens them further. The invaders are not new — they have always existed in the [[The Elemental Chaos|Elemental Chaos]] and [[The Abyss|Abyss]] — but now the walls are thin enough for them to push through.

---

## The Migration

Due to the depletion of resources caused by Entropy and Invasion, many have chosen to abandon their worlds and escape to [[The Void]] — the anomalous plane outside the [[World Axis Reference|World Axis]] where time moves differently and realities blend.
