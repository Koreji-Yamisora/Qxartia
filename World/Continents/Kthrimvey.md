## Overview

K'thrimvey is a continent of mist and memory — an endless, primordial forest where the boundary between past and present blurs like ink in water. The trees here are ancient beyond measure, their canopies so thick that sunlight reaches the forest floor only in thin, golden shafts. The air is heavy with moisture and the scent of decay — not rot, but the slow, sweet dissolution of things returning to the earth.

## Geography

### The Elder Canopy
The uppermost layer of K'thrimvey's forests, where trees grow so tall their crowns form a second sky. Some canopy-dwellers have never seen the ground. Bridges of woven vines and living branches connect treetop villages, and the air is thick with bioluminescent insects. At night, the canopy glows faintly green.

### The Root-Sea
The forest floor is not earth — it is a tangled web of roots, moss, and decomposing matter so deep that no one has ever found solid ground. Walking here requires skill; one wrong step and you sink. Entire ruins lie buried in the Root-Sea, their origins forgotten.

### The Mist Hollows
Clearings where the trees refuse to grow. The mist here is thick and cold, and sound behaves strangely — voices echo back in different languages, some of which no living person speaks. The Hollows are avoided by all but the most desperate or the most curious.

### The Memory Groves
Sacred circles where the oldest trees stand — some over ten thousand years old. These trees have absorbed so many memories that their bark is etched with faces, and their roots glow faintly at full moons. Pilgrims come to the Groves to **give memories** they wish to forget, or to **borrow memories** of things they never lived.

## Magic & Entropy

Magic in K'thrimvey is **organic** and **cyclical**. [[Mana]] is absorbed by living things and released slowly into the soil, where it feeds the fungi and roots below. See [[Entropy]] for the full taxonomy of Qxartia's slow forgetting.

### Regional Entropy Zones

| Region | Entropy Type | Effect |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **The Memory Groves** | [[Entropy#Memory\|Memory]] | Oldest trees absorb memories from visitors; pilgrims come to give or borrow memories; after ~10 years, trees forget their purpose |
| **The Mist Hollows** | [[Entropy#Sensory\|Sensory]] | Voices echo back in languages no one speaks; directions blur; some wanderers walk in circles for days |
| **The Root-Sea** | [[Entropy#Vital\|Vital]] | Life decays rapidly into the tangle; entire ruins sink forgotten; the floor itself is decomposing matter |
| **The Elder Canopy** | [[Entropy#Arcane\|Arcane]] | Strong mana concentration causes whispers — voices of the dead, fragments of old conversations; spells unravel faster here |

## Culture & People

The people of K'thrimvey are **dreamers**, **storytellers**, and **memory-keepers**. They believe that forgetting is not loss, but release — that holding onto the past too tightly damages both the holder and the held. Their culture is built around **oral tradition**, and their most sacred role is the **Listener** — those who sit beneath the oldest trees and translate the whispers into stories.

**The Great Unburdening** is a ritual performed once every decade, where entire villages gather to speak their heaviest memories aloud into the trees. By morning, the words are gone — absorbed, whispered, and forgotten.

**Common sayings**:
- *"The tree remembers so that you don't have to."*
- *"Let the mist take it."*
- *"We are all borrowed memories."*

## The Forgotten Celestial

> *From the Canopy Scrolls, passage unknown — translated from bark-script by the Listeners:*
>
> *"Of all the lights that drifted between stars, one could not stop* dreaming*. It imagined worlds that did not exist. It spoke to silences and heard answers. It remembered things that had not yet happened.*
>
> *When [[Selamonius]] — the Shaping Hand — came with form and ending, this one did not understand. It asked: 'What is form?' And Selamonius pressed it into root and leaf and mist. It asked: 'What is ending?' And Selamonius gave it seasons, and decay, and the slow unraveling of all things.*
>
> *Now it dreams still. But its dreams are fragmentary — whispered into the mist."*

> *From the Whisper-Hymns, sung at the Great Unburdening:*
>
> *"Shaped by the Hand that gave us edges,  
> Dreamer-who-forgot-the-stars,  
> We carry your questions in our marrow,  
> We speak your silence into the dark.  
> Forget us gently. We will remember."*
