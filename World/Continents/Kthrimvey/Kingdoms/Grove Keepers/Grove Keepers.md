# The Grove Keepers
_"We remember so the world can forget in peace."_

## Overview

In the heart of [[Kthrimvey]]'s ancient forests stand the **Memory Groves** — sacred circles where trees over ten thousand years old have absorbed so many memories that their bark is etched with faces and their roots glow at full moon. The **Grove Keepers** are the monastic order that tends these trees, translates their whispers, and guards the accumulated memories of countless generations.

They are priests, archivists, and therapists — offering the great service of *letting go*.

---

## The Sacred Mission

The Grove Keepers serve three purposes:

1. **Accept memories** others wish to forget
2. **Preserve memories** that would otherwise be lost to [[Entropy]]
3. **Share memories** with those who need wisdom they never lived

> *From the Whisper-Hymns: "The tree remembers so that you don't have to. Give us your burdens. We will hold them until even we forget."*

---

## The Hierarchy

Unlike many religious orders, the Grove Keepers value **silence** over rank:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **The Root-Tongue** | Supreme leader; speaks for the oldest tree |
| **Grove-Masters** | Each tends one sacred grove |
| **Listeners** | Sit beneath trees and translate whispers into stories |
| **Memory-Scribes** | Record what the trees say before it's lost |
| **Novices** | Learning to listen; may take decades |

> *The quietest Keeper is usually the wisest. The loudest is usually the newest.*

## Capital: Remembrance

See [[Remembrance]] for full details.

A city is perhaps too strong a word. **Remembrance** is a collection of monasteries, libraries, and pilgrim hostels scattered among the oldest Memory Grove. No building is taller than a sapling. Paths are marked by lanterns that burn with captured [[Mana]]. The silence is profound — but never empty.

At full moon, the entire grove glows from the roots, and pilgrims report hearing voices of the long-dead.

## The Memory Groves

Each Grove has its own character:

| Grove | Type of Memories |
|-------|------------------|
| **The Grove of Sorrow** | Grief, loss, mourning |
| **The Grove of Joy** | Celebrations, births, victories |
| **The Grove of Secrets** | Things people were afraid to speak |
| **The Grove of the Dead** | Final thoughts of the passing |
| **The Grove of Names** | Identities of those who wished to forget themselves |

> *Some say there's a sixth grove — the Grove of the First Forgetting — where the Celestial's own memories rest. No Keeper speaks of it.*

---

## Services

The Grove Keepers offer essential services to all of [[Qxartia]]:

| Service | Description | Cost |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Memory Unburdening** | Give a painful memory to a tree | Donation |
| **Memory Consultation** | Receive wisdom from collected memories | Moderate fee |
| **The Great Unburdening** | Village-wide memory release (decennial ritual) | Community tithe |
| **Memory Preservation** | Ensure a loved one's final words are recorded | High |
| **Memory Borrowing** | Experience something you never lived | Very high, requires approval |

---

## The Great Unburdening

Every decade, entire villages gather at the nearest Grove to **speak their heaviest memories aloud**. By morning, the words are absorbed by the trees — whispered, echoed, and slowly forgotten.

This is not magic. It is not therapy. It is *release*.

> *"I carried my mother's disappointment for thirty years. I gave it to the oak. Now I can hear her voice without wincing."*

## Economy

The Grove Keepers are technically poor but practically wealthy:

| Income | Source |
|--------|--------|
| **Donations** | For memory services |
| **Preserved Knowledge** | Scholars pay to consult tree-memories |
| **Transcriptions** | Selling copies of recovered memories as stories |
| **Pilgrim Trade** | Hostels, supplies, guides |

The Keepers live simply. Wealth is measured in **depth of listening**, not coin.

## Relations with Other Powers

| Power | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| [[Canopy Courts]] | Reluctant dependence — the Courts need memory preservation |
| [[Root-Sea Nomads]] | Partnership — Nomads bring recovered memories from ruins |
| [[Pulse-Keepers]] | Theological debate — who truly speaks for the land? |
| [[Marsh Wardens]] | Deep sympathy — both deal with the cost of forgetting |
| [[Stone-Singer Confederation]] | Mutual recognition — different translations of the same thing |

---

## The Keepers' Burden

Those who listen too long begin to absorb fragmented memories themselves. Older Keepers sometimes speak in voices not their own, recall places they've never been, mourn people they never met.

This is considered an honor, not a curse.

> *"I am root-touched now. Sometimes I remember being a child in a city that burned a thousand years ago. I comfort myself with lullabies I never learned."*
