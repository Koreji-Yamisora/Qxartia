# The Root-Sea Nomads
_"The ruins remember what the trees forget."_

## Overview

On the forest floor of [[Kthrimvey]] — if it can be called a floor — lies the **Root-Sea**: a tangle of roots, moss, and decomposed matter so deep that no one has ever found solid ground. Here, walking is an art, sinking is common, and entire civilizations lie buried in the organic mire.

The **Root-Sea Nomads** are the only people who call this place home. They travel in small bands, salvaging from the forgotten ruins, trading upward to the [[Canopy Courts]], and surviving on what others have discarded.

---

## The Bands

The Nomads have no central authority. They organize into **Bands** of 20-100 people:

| Band Type | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Drift-Bands** | Constant movement, trading and salvaging |
| **Anchor-Bands** | Semi-permanent camps at stable root-islands |
| **Deep-Bands** | Specialize in descending into the Root-Sea |
| **Sky-Bands** | Maintain relations with the Canopy Courts |

> *A Nomad is born to one band, may walk with three, and dies belonging to none.*

---

## Leadership: The Root-Speakers

Each band has a **Root-Speaker** — part navigator, part historian, part priest:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Root-Speaker** | Band leader; interprets the forest's whispers |
| **Path-Finder** | Navigates the shifting Root-Sea |
| **Memory-Keeper** | Records what the band discovers |
| **Ruin-Reader** | Identifies and assesses salvage sites |

Bands meet annually at the **Gathering of Voices** — a temporary city that forms, trades, celebrates, and dissolves within a single moon cycle.

---

## No Capital, But...

The Nomads have no permanent capital. However, three locations serve as meeting points:

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **The Gathering Clearing** | Annual meeting site (location changes) |
| **Sunfall Market** | Largest trade hub; where light reaches the floor |
| **The Archive of Sinking Things** | Where recovered artifacts are catalogued |

---

## The Root-Sea

The forest floor is not earth — it is:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Surface Tangle** | Roots, moss, stable-ish platforms |
| **The Soft Depths** | Decomposing matter; one wrong step and you sink |
| **The Buried Layer** | Ancient ruins, forgotten cities, strange artifacts |
| **Below** | No one who goes this deep returns |

> *The Root-Sea eats everything eventually. Buildings, bodies, memories — all become part of its floor.*

---

## Economy

The Nomads survive through salvage and trade:

| Work | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Ruin Salvage** | Recovering artifacts from buried cities |
| **Carrier Services** | Transporting goods between surface and Canopy |
| **Guiding** | Leading outsiders through the Root-Sea |
| **Memory Trade** | Selling recovered stories to the [[Grove Keepers]] |

> *The Canopy Courts call us scavengers. The Grove Keepers call us archaeologists. We call ourselves survivors.*

---

## The Buried Ruins

The Root-Sea contains the remains of **forgotten civilizations**:

| Ruin | Contents |
|------|----------|
| **The Drowned Temple** | Religious site; holy water still glows faintly |
| **Market of Silences** | Ancient trading post; coins still scattered underfoot |
| **The Speaking Hall** | Walls that whisper in dead languages |
| **The Deep Palace** | No one who entered has returned (yet) |

Some Nomads believe these were cities from before [[Selamonius|the Shaping]] — when the Celestials were still learning what form meant.

---

## Culture

Nomad culture emphasizes:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Lightness** | Travel light; don't anchor to things |
| **Memory Sharing** | What one remembers, all remember |
| **Respect the Ruins** | Take only what's offered; never disturb too deeply |
| **Suspicion of Above** | The Canopy Courts take but rarely give |

### The Sinking Song

When a Nomad dies, they are given to the Root-Sea:

> *"You walked the tangle. You found what was lost.*
> *Now the roots hold you. Now you are the floor.*
> *In a thousand years, someone will find what you carried.*
> *And they will remember that someone walked here."*

## Relations with Other Powers

| Power | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| [[Canopy Courts]] | Resentful dependence — they sell to us, buy from us, look down on us |
| [[Grove Keepers]] | Mutual respect — we find memories, they preserve them |
| [[Marsh Wardens]] | Kinship — both groups deal with things better forgotten |
| [[Fading Blades]] | Sometimes hire Nomad guides for expeditions |
