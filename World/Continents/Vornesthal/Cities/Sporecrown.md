# Sporecrown
_Capital of the Deep-Dweller Clans_

> Part of [[Deep-Dweller Clans]] · [[Vornesthal]] · [[Qxartia]] · [[Fungal Underdark]]

## Overview

Sporecrown is built around a massive **mana-mushroom** whose cap spans half a league — the largest fungal growth in [[Qxartia]]. The city spirals around its stem, with the wealthiest clans at the top (where [[Mana]] is freshest) and the poorest near the cave floor. The entire city pulses with a slow, purple-white glow.

## The Heartbeat

Once every three hours, the mana-mushroom pulses — a visible wave of light traveling from roots to cap. Citizens time their days by this rhythm.
