# The Deep-Dweller Clans
_"The sun is a rumor. The fungi are truth."_

> Part of [[Vornesthal]] · [[Qxartia]] · The [[Fungal Underdark]]

## Overview

Beneath the wind-scoured surface of [[Vornesthal]] lies another world entirely: the **Fungal Underdark**, a vast network of caves illuminated by bioluminescent fungi that pulse with stored [[Mana]]. Here, in the purple-white glow, live the **Deep-Dweller Clans** — a civilization that has not seen sunlight in generations and has no desire to.

They harvest mana-fungi, craft the finest magic stones in [[Qxartia]], and worship the **Heartbeat Beneath** — the slow, rhythmic pulse of mana that rises from depths no one has ever reached.

## The Clans

The Deep-Dwellers are divided into **thirteen clans**, each controlling a cave system:

| Clan | Specialty | Territory |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Sporewarden** | Fungi cultivation | The Glow Gardens |
| **Stonecradle** | Magic stone crafting | The Crystalline Halls |
| **Darkwater** | Underground rivers, fishing | The Pale Streams |
| **Rootreach** | Trade with surface | The Ascent Caves |
| **Echoheart** | Communication, messengers | The Speaking Caverns |
| **Moldweft** | Clothing, armor from fungi | The Weaving Grottoes |
| **Breathless** | Deep exploration | The Abyss Border |

> *There are six more clans. The Breathless say there are things below that swallowed them. The Rootreach say they simply moved deeper. Same difference.*

## Governance: The Undercrown Council

No single ruler governs the Deep-Dwellers. Instead, the **Undercrown Council** meets in **Sporecrown** to make collective decisions:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Clan-Voice** | Representative of each clan |
| **Depth-Keeper** | Monitors the unexplored lower levels |
| **Glow-Reader** | Interprets fungi luminescence patterns |
| **Surface-Speaker** | Manages relations with above-ground powers |

Voting is done by **bioluminescent consensus** — each clan holds a glowing fungal orb. Agreement makes the chamber bright; dissent dims it.

## Capital: Sporecrown

See [[Sporecrown]] for full details.

The largest cavern city, built around a massive **mana-mushroom** whose cap spans half a league. The city spirals around its stem, with the wealthiest clans closest to the top (where the mana is freshest) and the poorest near the cave floor.

At night — not that they distinguish day from night — the mushroom's glow pulses like a slow heartbeat.

---

## The Heartbeat Beneath

The Deep-Dwellers believe that far below their deepest caves, something *breathes*:

> *From the Spore-Songs: "Before the shaping, before the pillars sang, something waited in the dark. It waits still. Its heartbeat feeds the fungi. Its breath fills our lungs. We do not worship it. We are grateful to it."*

Some believe this is the core of [[The Forgotten Celestials|the Celestial]] that became Vornesthal — the part of it that could not be pressed into stone.

## Economy

The Deep-Dwellers control the most valuable resource in Vornesthal:

| Export | Use |

| **Mana-Fungi** | Raw magical material, alchemical ingredients |
| **Magic Stones** | Highest quality; last 3 weeks above ground |
| **Cave Pearls** | Rare, decorative, mana-storing |
| **Fungal Silk** | Light, strong, bioluminescent fabric |

| Import | Source |
|--------|--------|
| **Metal** | Surface mines |
