# The Stone-Singer Confederation
_"The pillars speak. We translate."_

## Overview

The Stone-Singer Confederation is a loose alliance of tribes scattered across the central plains of [[Vornesthal]], united by their shared devotion to **the Singing Pillars** — towering columns of pale stone that emit droning harmonies when wind passes through them. Each tribe claims a pillar field; each field produces a unique note; together, they form the **Stone-Song**.

The Confederation has no emperor, no single ruler. Instead, tribal elders meet at **Chorus Hall** to interpret the pillars' harmonies and debate their meaning.

## The Pillar Fields

Each tribe is named for their field's dominant note:

| Tribe | Note | Territory |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Bassvorn** | Deep, rumbling drone | The Lower Flats |
| **Keening Hollow** | High, mournful wail | Wind-carved canyons |
| **Harmoneth** | Middle tones, consonant | Central plains |
| **Dissonai** | Clashing, unsettling | Northern reaches |
| **Silenthold** | No sound — their pillars are silent | Eastern edge, near Entropy zones |

> *The Silenthold are considered cursed. They claim they're the only ones truly listening.*

## Governance: The Chorus Council

The Confederation is governed by the **Chorus Council**, which meets when major decisions are required:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Tone-Speakers** | Tribal representatives, one per tribe |
| **Listener-Prime** | Translates the combined Stone-Song into guidance |
| **Chord-Keepers** | Historians who record harmonies across generations |
| **Silence-Watcher** | Monitors for entropy's spread to new pillar fields |

Decisions are made by **harmonic consensus** — if the council cannot agree, they wait for the wind to change the Song and interpret its guidance.

## Capital: Chorus Hall

See [[Chorus Hall]] for full details.

A city built around the only place where travelers can hear **all five tribal notes** at once — a natural amphitheater where the wind creates a constantly shifting symphony. Buildings are carved from the same pale stone as the pillars. No structure is taller than the shortest pillar; it would be sacrilege.

## The Stone-Song

The Pillars' sound is more than music — it is believed to be the **last voice** of [[The Forgotten Celestials|the Celestial]] who became Vornesthal:

| Interpretation | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| **Deep tones** | Contentment, stability |
| **High tones** | Warning, change approaching |
| **Harmony** | The land approves |
| **Dissonance** | Conflict brewing, entropy advancing |
| **Silence** | The worst omen — the Celestial is forgetting that note |

> *From the Lithic Tablets: "The Stone-Song is not music. It is breathing. It is the last breath of one who endured, stretched across eons."*

## Economy

The Confederation is poor by other kingdoms' standards but rich in what matters:

| Resource | Use |
|----------|-----|
| **Pillar-Dust** | Shed from the pillars; used in magic stone crafting |
| **Wind-Charts** | Predictions of weather patterns, sold to travelers |
| **Chord-Readings** | Spiritual consultations for other kingdoms |
| **Pale Stone** | Quality building material (harvesting regulated) |

---

## Military: The Resonance Guard

The Confederation's fighters are called **Resonance Guards**:

| Unit | Role |
|------|------|
| **Wind-Runners** | Scouts who navigate by sound |
| **Pillar-Defenders** | Protect sacred sites from exploitation |
| **Tone-Warriors** | Use resonant weapons that disorient enemies |
| **Silence-Breakers** | Specialists who fight in entropy-dead zones |

---

## Relations with Other Powers

| Power | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| [[Deep-Dweller Clans]] | Trade partners — exchange surface goods for fungal mana |
| [[Salt Lords of Karveth]] | Tense — Salt Lords want to harvest pillar-dust commercially |
| [[Veinian Oligarchy]] | Trade grain for stone, but Oligarchs find them "mystical and slow" |
| [[Pulse-Keepers]] | Theological friction — both claim to interpret nature's voice |

---

## The Silenthold Schism

In recent generations, the **Silenthold tribe** has grown increasingly isolated. Their pillars fell silent three centuries ago — a sign, some say, of [[Entropy]]'s advance. The Silenthold believe the opposite: that silence is the truest form of communication, and the other tribes have been mishearing the Song all along.

This theological divide threatens to fracture the Confederation.
