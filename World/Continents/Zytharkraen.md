# Zytharkraen
_"The Earth That Breathes"_

> Part of [[Qxartia]] · One of the [[The Drifting Ones|Drifting Ones]] · Shaped by [[Selamonius]]

---

## Overview

Zytharkraen is the most fertile of Qxartia's three supercontinents — a vast expanse of rolling hills, mist-veiled valleys, and ancient forests that stretch unbroken for hundreds of leagues. Rivers carve deep channels through its dark, mineral-rich soil, and the air itself carries the faint hum of [[Mana]]. At dawn, the ground exhales a soft warmth, as if the earth is breathing — a phenomenon locals call **the Pulse**.

---

## Geography

### The Veinian Heartlands
The central basin of Zytharkraen, where the soil is so rich that crops grow within days — and wither within weeks. Farmers here practice **rotational abandonment**, letting entire fields dissolve back into the earth before replanting. Villages are semi-nomadic, shifting location once a generation.

### The Breathing Forests
Vast woodlands where trees grow impossibly tall, their roots so deep they drink from the Pulse itself. The bark of **mana-oaks** glows faintly blue at twilight. But no tree in the Breathing Forests lives longer than a century — when they die, they collapse inward, leaving neither wood nor seed.

### The Wandering Rivers
Rivers here do not flow to the sea. They meander in slow, spiraling paths, sometimes reversing direction or vanishing into the soil entirely. Cartographers must redraw maps every decade. Some believe the rivers are *dreaming*.

### The Hollow Marshes
The southern edge of Zytharkraen, where the land has begun to lose its memory. Trees stand skeletal and pale. The Pulse is weak here — almost silent. Some wanderers who enter never return, not because they die, but because they *forget how to leave*.

---

## Magic & Entropy

[[Mana]] flows **fast** and **freely** in Zytharkraen, drawn up by the Pulse each dawn. See [[Entropy]] for the full taxonomy of Qxartia's slow forgetting.

### Regional Entropy Zones

| Region | Entropy Type | Effect |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **The Breathing Forests** | [[Entropy#Vital\|Vital]] | Trees grow impossibly fast, then collapse into dust within a century; mana-oaks lose their glow after a single harvest |
| **The Hollow Marshes** | [[Entropy#Memory\|Memory]] | Wanderers forget their purpose; long-time residents lose old memories softly, like waking from a dream |
| **The Veinian Heartlands** | [[Entropy#Temporal\|Temporal]] | Crops grow in days and wither in weeks; the land's rhythm is compressed, forcing rotational abandonment |
| **Near Pulse Vents** | [[Entropy#Arcane\|Arcane]] | Spells last only 1–2 days; mana stones absorb quickly but lose charge within a week |

> 🌱 *In Zytharkraen, life blooms fast and dies quietly. The land gives everything — and takes it back gently.*

---

## Culture & People

The people of Zytharkraen are **patient** and **cyclical** in their thinking. They do not mourn loss the way outsiders do — instead, they celebrate **Return Days**, marking the anniversaries of things that have been forgotten.

**Common sayings**:
- *"The soil remembers what we forget."*
- *"Plant today, mourn tomorrow, plant again."*
- *"The Pulse will know."*

## Political Landscape

### The Three Powers

After the [[Fallen Holy Empire]]'s collapse 200 years ago, three factions rose to fill the vacuum:

#### The Veinian Oligarchy
**Capital**: [[Veinia Prime]]
**Leader**: High Merchant Councilor **Thessa Valdren** (human, 60s, pragmatic)
**Philosophy**: *"Wealth is the only stability."*

The merchant houses that controlled Imperial trade simply... kept trading. When the temples burned, the granaries remained. The Oligarchy controls:
- All major food production
- Primary trade routes
- The largest mercenary contracts

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Vast wealth | No loyalty beyond coin |
| Food monopoly | Population resentment |
| Mercenary armies | Vulnerable to Entropy |

**Current Goals**:
- Expand farming into Pulse Vent territories
- Maintain trade dominance
- Suppress peasant unrest

---

#### The Pulse-Keepers
**Capital**: [[Breathlight]]  
**Leader**: High Voice **Endara the Unsleeping** (half-elf, 300+, visionary/fanatic)
**Philosophy**: *"The Pulse is the last breath of a dying god. We protect what remains."*

A religious order that split from the Empire before its fall. They worship the Pulse itself as the remnant soul of the [[The Drifting Ones|Drifting One]] that became Zytharkraen. They control:
- All Pulse Vent territories
- Primary mana supply
- The hearts of the devout poor

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| True believers | Fanaticism |
| Mana monopoly | Small military |
| Moral authority | Inflexible |

**Current Goals**:
- Prevent Oligarchy expansion into sacred lands
- Convert or expel non-believers from Pulse zones
- Prepare for the "Final Breath" — a prophesied end

---

#### The Marsh Wardens
**Capital**: [[Hollowmarch]]
**Leader**: Warden-Commander **Bracken Greymoor** (human, 50s, exhausted soldier)
**Philosophy**: *"We hold the line. That's all."*

Once an Imperial military order tasked with containing the Hollow Marshes. When the Empire fell, they simply stayed at their posts. They control:
- The entire southern border
- Containment of Memory Entropy
- The only experienced anti-Invasion forces

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Elite soldiers | Underfunded |
| Entropy experience | High casualties |
| Respected | Isolated |

**Current Goals**:
- Hold the Hollow line
- Get resources from the Oligarchy or Keepers — anyone
- Survive

## Recent History (200 Years)

### The Imperial Collapse (Year 0)
The [[Fallen Holy Empire]] burns. Temples across Zytharkraen are sacked. The Eternal Basilica in [[Veinia Prime]] is looted, then converted into the Merchant Council Hall. Clerics flee or are executed. The Inquisition goes underground.

### The Scramble (Years 1-20)
Chaos reigns. Warlords, merchant princes, and self-proclaimed prophets carve up the continent. Dozens of petty kingdoms rise and fall. The Hollow Marshes expand during the chaos, consuming three frontier towns.

### The Veinian Consolidation (Years 20-50)
The merchant houses of [[Veinia Prime]] form a council. They hire the [[Fading Blades]] and [[Dawn Company]] to crush rival warlords. By Year 50, the Oligarchy controls the Heartlands.

### The First Pulse War (Years 52-55)
The Oligarchy attempts to seize Pulse Vent territories. The Pulse-Keepers resist. Three years of bloody conflict end in stalemate. The Treaty of Breathlight establishes current borders.

### The Warden Pact (Year 60)
The Marsh Wardens — abandoned by all sides — negotiate independence. In exchange for containment of the Hollows, they receive (in theory) resources from both factions. In practice, the resources rarely arrive.

### The Century of Peace (Years 60-160)
Relative stability. Trade flourishes. [[Entropy]] is manageable. The Oligarchy grows rich. The Keepers grow zealous. The Wardens grow desperate. Everyone pretends this will last.

### The Hollow Breach (Year 178)
Memory Eaters and Entropy Worms break through the Warden lines at **Fort Stillwater**. 200 soldiers are lost — not dead, but *forgotten*. The Wardens retreat to [[Hollowmarch]]. The Oligarchy debates whether to help or build walls.

### The Harvest Tensions (Years 180-Present)
Crop yields decline as Temporal [[Entropy]] accelerates. The Oligarchy demands access to Pulse Vent lands. The Keepers refuse. Both sides fund proxy conflicts. War feels inevitable.

### Today (Year ~200)
- The **Harvest War** is cold but heating up
- The **Hollow Breach** grows larger each year
- **Imperial Remnants** operate in secret
- **Refugees** flee north from the marshes
- **Adventurers** are in high demand

---

## Current Conflicts

### The Harvest War (Cold)
**Parties**: Veinian Oligarchy vs. Pulse-Keepers
**Status**: Proxy war, escalating

Neither side wants open war — yet. Instead:
- Mercenary companies raid each other's territory
- Caravans vanish on disputed roads
- Assassins target mid-level officials
- Propaganda war for peasant hearts

> ⚔️ *The Oligarchy has money. The Keepers have faith. Neither has enough soldiers to win outright — so they bleed each other slowly.*

**Adventure Hooks**:
- Escort a grain shipment through contested territory
- Investigate who burned the Miller's Guild warehouse
- Negotiate a secret peace between faction moderates

---

### The Hollow Breach (Active Crisis)
**Parties**: Marsh Wardens vs. Invasion creatures
**Status**: Losing battle

The Wardens are overwhelmed. Memory Eaters consume identity. Entropy Worms devour ley lines. Every month, the containment line shrinks.

| Year | Hollow Border |
|------|---------------|
| 160 | 100 leagues from Heartlands |
| 178 | 80 leagues (Fort Stillwater falls) |
| 195 | 60 leagues |
| Present | 45 leagues — and closing |

**Adventure Hooks**:
- Rescue survivors from a fallen outpost
- Retrieve an artifact from Fort Stillwater (now Entropy zone)
- Find the source of the breach — what broke containment?

---

### The Imperial Underground (Secret)
**Parties**: Remnant Inquisitors vs. scholars/factions
**Status**: Secret insurgency

Cells of loyalists work to restore the Empire:
- Assassinate those who teach about [[The Pantheon]]
- Recover Pantheon artifacts before they're studied
- Infiltrate the Oligarchy and Keepers
- Await "God's Return"

**Adventure Hooks**:
- Protect a scholar who found forbidden texts
- Infiltrate an Inquisitor cell
- Discover a high-ranking official is a Remnant agent

---

### The Peasant Unrest (Simmering)
**Parties**: Common folk vs. Veinian Oligarchy
**Status**: Growing discontent

The Oligarchy grows rich while farmers work accelerating fields. Taxes rise. Food exports continue while locals go hungry. A movement called the **Seedlings** spreads — part labor union, part revolutionary cell.

**Adventure Hooks**:
- Mediate between Oligarchy and Seedling leaders
- Investigate whether the Keepers are funding the Seedlings
- Stop a Seedling sabotage plot — or help it succeed

## The Forgotten Celestial

> *From the Veinian Codex, fragment 7 — recovered from the Root-Sea, author unknown:*
>
> *"Before the world had names, there were those who drifted between stars — beings of light and breath and endless dreaming. They had no form. They had no death. They simply* were.
>
> *It is said that [[Selamonius]] — the Shaping Hand — gathered these drifting ones and pressed them into form. Gave them weight. Gave them edges. Gave them endings.*
>
> *Zytharkraen is one such being — a celestial who once breathed starlight, now pressed into soil and root and river. The Pulse is its last breath, still exhaling after eons."*

> *From the [[Book of Forgotten Names]], verse 12:*
>
> *"And Selamonius spoke unto the light: 'You will be earth. You will feed. You will give, and you will be taken from.' And the light wept, and its tears became the first rain."*
