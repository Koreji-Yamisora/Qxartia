# Zytharkraen
_"The Earth That Breathes"_

> Part of [[Qxartia]] · One of the [[The Drifting Ones|Drifting Ones]] · Shaped by [[Selamonius]]

## Overview

Zytharkraen is the most fertile of Qxartia's three supercontinents — a vast expanse of rolling hills, mist-veiled valleys, and ancient forests that stretch unbroken for hundreds of leagues. Rivers carve deep channels through its dark, mineral-rich soil, and the air itself carries the faint hum of [[Mana]]. At dawn, the ground exhales a soft warmth, as if the earth is breathing — a phenomenon locals call **the Pulse**.

## Geography

### The Veinian Heartlands
The central basin of Zytharkraen, where the soil is so rich that crops grow within days — and wither within weeks. Farmers here practice **rotational abandonment**, letting entire fields dissolve back into the earth before replanting. Villages are semi-nomadic, shifting location once a generation.

### The Breathing Forests
Vast woodlands where trees grow impossibly tall, their roots so deep they drink from the Pulse itself. The bark of **mana-oaks** glows faintly blue at twilight. But no tree in the Breathing Forests lives longer than a century — when they die, they collapse inward, leaving neither wood nor seed.

### The Wandering Rivers
Rivers here do not flow to the sea. They meander in slow, spiraling paths, sometimes reversing direction or vanishing into the soil entirely. Cartographers must redraw maps every decade. Some believe the rivers are *dreaming*.

### The Hollow Marshes
The southern edge of Zytharkraen, where the land has begun to lose its memory. Trees stand skeletal and pale. The Pulse is weak here — almost silent. Some wanderers who enter never return, not because they die, but because they *forget how to leave*.

## Magic & Entropy

[[Mana]] flows **fast** and **freely** in Zytharkraen, drawn up by the Pulse each dawn. See [[Entropy]] for the full taxonomy of Qxartia's slow forgetting.

### Regional Entropy Zones

| Region | Entropy Type | Effect |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **The Breathing Forests** | [[Entropy#Vital\|Vital]] | Trees grow impossibly fast, then collapse into dust within a century; mana-oaks lose their glow after a single harvest |
| **The Hollow Marshes** | [[Entropy#Memory\|Memory]] | Wanderers forget their purpose; long-time residents lose old memories softly, like waking from a dream |
| **The Veinian Heartlands** | [[Entropy#Temporal\|Temporal]] | Crops grow in days and wither in weeks; the land's rhythm is compressed, forcing rotational abandonment |
| **Near Pulse Vents** | [[Entropy#Arcane\|Arcane]] | Spells last only 1–2 days; mana stones absorb quickly but lose charge within a week |

> 🌱 *In Zytharkraen, life blooms fast and dies quietly. The land gives everything — and takes it back gently.*

## Culture & People

The people of Zytharkraen are **patient** and **cyclical** in their thinking. They do not mourn loss the way outsiders do — instead, they celebrate **Return Days**, marking the anniversaries of things that have been forgotten.

**Common sayings**:
- *"The soil remembers what we forget."*
- *"Plant today, mourn tomorrow, plant again."*
- *"The Pulse will know."*

## The Forgotten Celestial

> *From the Veinian Codex, fragment 7 — recovered from the Root-Sea, author unknown:*
>
> *"Before the world had names, there were those who drifted between stars — beings of light and breath and endless dreaming. They had no form. They had no death. They simply* were.
>
> *It is said that [[Selamonius]] — the Shaping Hand — gathered these drifting ones and pressed them into form. Gave them weight. Gave them edges. Gave them endings.*
>
> *Zytharkraen is one such being — a celestial who once breathed starlight, now pressed into soil and root and river. The Pulse is its last breath, still exhaling after eons."*

> *From the [[Book of Forgotten Names]], verse 12:*
>
> *"And Selamonius spoke unto the light: 'You will be earth. You will feed. You will give, and you will be taken from.' And the light wept, and its tears became the first rain."*
