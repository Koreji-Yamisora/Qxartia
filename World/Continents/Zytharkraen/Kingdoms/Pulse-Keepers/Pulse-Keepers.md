# The Pulse-Keepers
_"The Pulse knows. The Pulse provides. The Pulse demands."_

## Overview

The Pulse-Keepers are not a kingdom but a **theocracy** — a religious order that has claimed spiritual dominion over [[Zytharkraen]]'s most sacred phenomenon: **the Pulse**, the rhythmic exhalation of [[Mana]] that occurs at dawn across the entire supercontinent.

From their holy city of **Breathlight**, the Pulse-Keepers dictate the timing of planting, harvesting, and spellcasting. To defy them is to defy the land itself — or so they teach.

## The Doctrine of Timing

The Pulse-Keepers believe that [[Mana]] is not a resource but a **breath** — the land exhaling the remnants of its celestial self. To use mana at the wrong moment is sacrilege; to use it at the right moment is prayer.

| Timing | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Dawn** | Most sacred — mana is freshest, prayers answered |
| **Midday** | Neutral — safe for commerce, labor |
| **Dusk** | Dangerous — mana fades, spells may corrupt |
| **Night** | Forbidden — only the desperate cast at night |

> *Every farmer knows: plant at dawn or plant for ghosts.*

## Capital: Breathlight

See [[Breathlight]] for full details.

A city built on a nexus where the Pulse is strongest. Towers of white stone spiral upward, their tips catching the first light of dawn. The streets are silent until sunrise, when the **Morning Hymn** echoes from every temple — a city-wide prayer timed to the land's exhale.

## The Temporal Calendar

The Pulse-Keepers maintain the **official calendar** of Zytharkraen:

| Period | Length | Significance |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Pulse-Days** | 7 per cycle | Named for the Seven Breaths |
| **Exhalation Week** | 7 days | The standard week |
| **Decay Month** | 4 weeks | Time before crops begin to fade |
| **Renewal Season** | 3 months | One growing cycle (extremely short by other worlds' standards) |

## Services & Influence

The Pulse-Keepers offer essential services — for a tithe:

| Service | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Dawn Blessing** | 10% of harvest | Crops grow aligned with the Pulse |
| **Timing Consultation** | Gold/grain | Advice on optimal casting moments |
| **Entropy Reading** | High | Predict when a field will decay |
| **Last Breath Rite** | Variable | Funeral ensuring the soul dissipates cleanly |

## Tensions & Heresies

Not everyone accepts the Pulse-Keepers' authority:

- **The [[Veinian Oligarchy]]** resents paying tithes but needs the timing guidance
- **Night-Casters** — forbidden mages who believe dusk and night magic is *more* powerful, not less
- **Pulse Skeptics** — scholars who believe the Pulse is just geology, not divinity

### The Heresy of the Second Breath
A secret belief that the Pulse has a *second exhalation* at midnight — one the Keepers suppress because it would undermine their control of dawn.

## Military: The Dawn Guard

The Pulse-Keepers maintain a small but elite force:

| Unit | Role |
|------|------|
| **Sunbearers** | Temple guardians, ceremonial duties |
| **Timing Inquisitors** | Hunt night-casters and heretics |
| **Breath-Seers** | Magical scouts who sense mana fluctuations |

## Relations with Other Powers

| Power | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| [[Veinian Oligarchy]] | Exploitative symbiosis — they pay, we bless |
| [[Marsh Wardens]] | Provide spiritual support but consider them too close to [[Entropy]] |
| [[Grove Keepers]] | Theological rivals — both claim to interpret nature's voice |
| [[Deep-Dweller Clans]] | Suspicion — they live where the Pulse cannot reach |
