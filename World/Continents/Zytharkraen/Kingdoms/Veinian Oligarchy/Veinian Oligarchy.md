## Overview

The Veinian Oligarchy rules the fertile heartlands of [[Zytharkraen]] — the **Veinian Heartlands** — where the soil is so rich that crops grow in days and empires are built on harvest. This is not a kingdom of kings, but of **merchant-lords** and **farming magnates** whose wealth is measured in bushels, not crowns.

Seven **Great Houses** control the Oligarchy, each claiming dominion over different agricultural sectors. Their council meets in **Veinia Prime**, where gold changes hands faster than the Pulse beats.

## The Seven Great Houses

| House | Domain | Symbol |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **House Thornweald** | Grain and staples | Golden wheat sheaf |
| **House Verdantis** | Exotic plants and herbs | Coiled vine |
| **House Rootholm** | Root vegetables, tubers | Uprooted tree |
| **House Mistbloom** | Flowers, perfumes, dyes | Purple blossom in fog |
| **House Pulsewater** | Irrigation, water rights | Three ripples |
| **House Decaya** | Entropy-resistant crops | Withered leaf sprouting |
| **House Goldsoil** | Land ownership, loans | Coin half-buried in earth |

> *When House Goldsoil forecloses on your fields, House Decaya buys your seeds, and House Pulsewater shuts off your water — you learn that kings are temporary, but debt is eternal.*

## Government

The Oligarchy is ruled by the **Septennial Council** — seven representatives, one from each Great House. Decisions require at least four votes, leading to constant deal-making, bribery, and occasionally assassination.

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Harvest-Lord** | Rotating position; manages seasonal logistics |
| **Tithe-Master** | Collects taxes in crops, not coin |
| **Seed-Keeper** | Controls the official seed vaults |
| **Decay-Watcher** | Monitors [[Entropy]] effects on harvests |

## Capital: Veinia Prime

See [[Veinia Prime]] for full details.

A city of contrasts: gleaming merchant halls rising above worker slums. The **Granary Spires** — tall silos enchanted to slow [[Entropy]] — dominate the skyline. At night, purple [[Mana]] light spills from the windows of the wealthy, while the outer districts burn tallow.

---

## Economy

The Veinian Oligarchy is the **breadbasket of Qxartia**:

- Exports: Mana-enriched grain, Pulse-water, short-lived enchanted produce
- Imports: Magic stones from [[Vornesthal]], Memory-wood from [[Kthrimvey]], mercenaries
- Currency: **Seed-marks** — tokens backed by future harvests

> *The problem with Seed-marks: in Zytharkraen, the future is two weeks away.*

│   The Seven Great Houses        │ ← Oligarchs, untouchable
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Lesser Houses & Merchants     │ ← Wealthy, but beholden
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Free Farmers                  │ ← Own land, often in debt
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Tenant Farmers                │ ← Work others' land
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Harvest Servants              │ ← Indentured labor

## Conflict: The Debt Spiral

The Oligarchy's greatest internal crisis is debt. When crops decay before they can be sold — as [[Entropy]] often causes — farmers cannot repay loans. House Goldsoil forecloses, Decaya claims the seeds, and another family falls into **Harvest Servitude**.

Some call it slavery with better paperwork. Reformers are rare and rarely live long.

## Relations with Other Powers

| Power | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| [[Pulse-Keepers]] | Tense alliance — Oligarchs need their mana-timing |
| [[Marsh Wardens]] | Pity mixed with exploitation — sell them supplies at markup |
| [[Stone-Singer Confederation]] | Trade partners — Vornesthal stones for Veinian grain |
| [[Canopy Courts]] | Mutual disdain — they consider trade "vulgar" |
