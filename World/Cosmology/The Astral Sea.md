## What Common Folk Believe (The Fallen Holy Empire's Version)

> *The official doctrine:*

The Astral Sea is **God's Light** — the infinite radiance of [[Selamonius|God]]'s presence that surrounds all creation. It is perfect, unchanging, and mortals are not meant to reach it.

Those who claim to have traveled there are liars or madmen. The heavens are not for mortal feet.

> ✨ *"Look not upon the silver void. It is God's domain, and you are but dust."*
> — Temple teaching

## What Actually Exists (The Hidden Truth)

> *Fragments from forbidden texts:*

The Astral Sea is a **fundamental plane** — one of the two great realms that bound the cosmology, existing "above" the [[Material Plane]] in the [[World Axis]] model.

It is an endless silvery void where thought and will have power. Ideas can take form here. Emotions can become landscapes. And within its infinite expanse float the **[[astral dominions]]** — the realms of gods.

## Properties of the Astral Sea

| Aspect | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Infinite extent** | Travel forever and never reach an edge |
| **Silvery void** | No ground, no sky — just endless silver mist |
| **Thought-responsive** | Strong will can shape local reality |
| **Timeless** | Travelers do not age, do not hunger, do not tire |
| **Color pools** | Portals to other planes appear as swirling pools of color |

> 💡 *In the Astral Sea, you do not walk. You think yourself forward. Distance is measured in will, not miles.*

## The Astral Dominions

Floating within the Astral Sea are **dominions** — pocket realms shaped by godly will or mortal belief:

| Dominion | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **[[The Celestial]]** | Former home of [[The Pantheon]] | **Severed** — unreachable since [[The Severing]] |
| **Unknown dominions** | Other realms may float in the infinite void | Unexplored by mortals of [[Qxartia]] |

Before [[The Severing]], the dominions were connected by divine pathways. Now they drift freely, unmoored.

> ⚠️ *If you could travel far enough through the Astral Sea, you might find dominions belonging to gods worshipped by beings from other material planes entirely. But such a journey would take lifetimes — and the Astral Sea is not empty.*

---

## What Dwells There

The Astral Sea has its own inhabitants:

| Being | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Githyanki** | Martial raiders who build fortresses on the corpses of dead gods |
| **Astral Dreadnoughts** | Titanic creatures that devour travelers |
| **Thought Fragments** | Echoes of powerful minds, harmless or hostile |
| **Angels** | Servants of gods — rarely seen since the dominions were severed |

> 💀 *The githyanki claim their greatest city is built on the body of a god who died before [[The Severing]]. They do not say which god.*

## Reaching the Astral Sea

Few mortals reach the Astral Sea:

| Method | Difficulty |
|--------|-----------|
| **Astral projection** | Rare magic that sends the mind, not the body |
| **Color pools** | Found in remote locations — dangerous and unpredictable |
| **Death** | Souls pass through the Astral briefly on their way to judgment |
| **Planar rifts** | [[The Severing]] left cracks — some still weep silver light |
