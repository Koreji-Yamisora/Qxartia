## What It Was

The Celestial was the realm where [[The Pantheon]] dwelt — the second generation of gods who created the world.

It existed above the [[The Feywild|Feywild]], accessible only to those who crossed the bright reflection and earned passage. The Archfey served as gatekeepers. Mortals who reached the Celestial could speak with gods, bargain for blessings, or face divine judgment.

## The Severing

When the last of the Pantheon fell — all save [[Selamonius]] — the connection to the Celestial was **severed**.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Mortals could reach the Celestial through the Feywild | The path leads nowhere |
| Prayers were sometimes answered directly | [[Selamonius\|God]] is silent or distant |
| Divine emissaries walked the mortal plane | No celestials have been seen in ages |
| The Archfey served as divine gatekeepers | The Archfey now serve only themselves |

> 🌑 *The Celestial may still exist. But no one can reach it. And nothing comes from it.*

## Why Was It Severed?

No mortal knows for certain. Theories whispered by forbidden scholars:

- [[Selamonius]] severed it **deliberately** — to protect herself or to punish the mortal world
- The death of the other Pantheon gods **broke** the connection naturally
- Something **else** severed it — an enemy, an accident, or a sacrifice
- The [[Fallen Holy Empire]] knows the truth and hides it

## What Remains

The Celestial left echoes in the mortal world:

| Echo | Location |
|------|----------|
| **Fallen Temples** | Ruins where the Pantheon was once worshipped |
| **Silent Altars** | Shrines where prayers go unanswered |
| **Broken Gates** | Places in the Feywild where the path to Celestial once opened |
| **Relics** | Artifacts that still carry traces of divine power |

Some say that if the Celestial could be reopened, the age of miracles might return.

Others say that whatever is on the other side now... might not be what was there before.

## Selamonius Remains

[[Selamonius]] is the last of [[The Pantheon]] — and she is not in the Celestial.

Most common folk call her simply "God" and believe she watches from above. But the truth is: **no one knows where Selamonius is**. She does not answer prayers. She does not send visions. She shaped the world, and then... silence.

> *"God made the world. God is watching. That's what we're told. But has anyone ever seen her? Heard her? Have the heavens opened even once in a thousand years?"*
> — A heretical scholar, shortly before their disappearance
