## What Common Folk Believe (The Fallen Holy Empire's Version)

> *The official doctrine:*

The Elemental Chaos is **Hell** — the burning pit where [[Selamonius|God]] casts the wicked. Fire, ice, lightning, and stone torment sinners for eternity. The demons and primordials that dwell there are God's instruments of punishment.

Fear the Chaos. Obey the Church. Avoid damnation.

> 🔥 *"The Chaos awaits those who defy God's law. Its fire never quenches. Its cold never warms."*
> — Funeral blessing for the condemned

## What Actually Exists (The Hidden Truth)

> *Fragments from forbidden texts:*

The Elemental Chaos is a **fundamental plane** — one of the two great realms that bound the cosmology, existing "below" the [[Material Plane]] in the [[World Axis]] model.

It is not punishment. It is **raw creation** — the churning, unstable matter from which the world was first forged. Here, fire becomes ice becomes stone becomes lightning becomes something with no name, all in the span of a thought.

## Origins

The Elemental Chaos did not always exist in its current form.

Before [[The Severing]], there were distinct elemental planes — Air, Water, Earth, Fire — and energy planes of positive and negative force. When the cosmic bonds shattered, these planes **collapsed into one another**, fusing into the churning maelstrom now called the Elemental Chaos.

| Before The Severing | After The Severing |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Elemental Plane of Fire | All merged into → |
| Elemental Plane of Water | → The Elemental Chaos |
| Elemental Plane of Earth | |
| Elemental Plane of Air | |
| Positive Energy Plane | |
| Negative Energy Plane | Partially merged into [[The Shadowfell]] |

> 💡 *The Elemental Chaos is the scar left by cosmic collision. It is what happens when fundamental forces lose their boundaries.*

## Properties of the Elemental Chaos

| Aspect | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Infinite extent** | No edges, no end |
| **Constant flux** | Environments shift without warning |
| **Hostile to life** | Mortals without protection die quickly |
| **No fixed gravity** | "Down" is whatever the local matter decides |
| **Raw elemental energy** | The building blocks of reality in pure form |

## The Elemental Realms

Within the Chaos, beings of sufficient power have carved out stable domains:

| Realm | Ruler | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **[[The Abyss]]** | Demon Lords (contested) | A multi-layered pit at the "bottom" — home of demons |
| **The Undying Pyre** | Kossuth (primordial) | Realm of eternal flame |
| **Root Hold** | Grumbar (primordial) | Vast subterranean halls of stone |
| **Sky Home** | Akadi (primordial) | Rolling clouds and endless storms |
| **Cresting Spires** | Istishia (primordial) | Towers of frozen water |

> ⚠️ *The primordials are not gods. They are something older — beings of pure element who shaped the world alongside [[The Pantheon]], then vanished or withdrew when the gods claimed dominion.*

## What Dwells There

| Being | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Elementals** | Living manifestations of fire, water, earth, air |
| **Primordials** | God-like beings of elemental power — mostly dormant |
| **Genies** | Djinn, efreet, marid, dao — elemental lords who build empires |
| **Demons** | Native to [[The Abyss]], spreading corruption through the Chaos |
| **Slaadi** | Frog-like beings of pure chaos, spawning endlessly |

---

## Reaching the Elemental Chaos

| Method | Difficulty |
|--------|-----------|
| **Planar rifts** | [[The Severing]] left cracks — some still spew elemental matter |
| **Summoning gone wrong** | Summoners who lose control may be pulled through |
| **The deep places** | Caverns deep enough may break through into the Chaos |
| **Portals** | Ancient gates exist — most are unmapped or trapped |

## The Abyss Connection

[[The Abyss]] sits at the lowest point of the Elemental Chaos — a pit that draws in the darkest energies. It is a realm within a realm, not separate but distinct.

> 🌑 *"The Chaos creates. The Abyss corrupts. They are the same realm — but the Abyss is where creation went wrong."*
> — Forbidden demonologist text
