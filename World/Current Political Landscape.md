# Current Political Landscape
_"Who Rules, Who Fights, and Why"_

> The state of [[Qxartia]] approximately 200 years after the [[Fallen Holy Empire]]'s collapse

---

## Overview

The fall of the [[Fallen Holy Empire]] left a power vacuum across all three continents. Where once a single religious authority controlled trade, law, and faith, now a fragmented patchwork of kingdoms, city-states, and factions compete for dominance — all while [[Entropy]] accelerates and [[Invasion]] presses at the borders of reality.

This document covers the **current political state** and **active conflicts** across Qxartia.

# Zytharkraen — The Fractured Heartland

> _"The Earth That Breathes"_ — Home of the Pulse

## Major Powers

### The Veinian Oligarchy
**Capital**: [[Veinia Prime]]
**Government**: Council of merchant-lords
**Philosophy**: Wealth is stability

The richest faction in Zytharkraen, controlling the fertile Heartlands and most trade routes. The Oligarchy rose from the ashes of Imperial commerce — when the Empire fell, the merchants simply... kept trading.

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Vast agricultural wealth | No standing army — relies on mercenaries |
| Controls food supply | Population resents wealth inequality |
| Trade alliances across continents | Vulnerable to Entropy affecting crops |

### The Pulse-Keepers
**Capital**: [[Breathlight]]
**Government**: Theocratic council
**Philosophy**: The Pulse is sacred — protect it at all costs

A religious order that broke from the Empire before its fall. They believe the Pulse (Zytharkraen's rhythmic mana exhalation) is the breath of the continent's celestial soul and must be protected. They control mana-rich territories and oppose exploitation.

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Control of Pulse Vents — mana supply | Fanaticism alienates allies |
| Devout, zealous followers | Small population |
| Legitimacy as "protectors" | Conflict with merchants over land use |

### The Marsh Wardens
**Capital**: [[Hollowmarch]]
**Government**: Military council
**Philosophy**: The Hollows must be contained

Guardians of the southern [[Entropy]]-heavy Hollow Marshes. They exist to prevent Memory Entropy from spreading north. Once an Imperial order, they now operate independently — grim, disciplined, and underfunded.

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Elite soldiers hardened by Entropy | Isolated, few allies |
| Experience fighting Invasion creatures | Chronic resource shortage |
| Respected as necessary protectors | Morale problems — high casualty rate |

## Current Conflicts in Zytharkraen

### The Harvest War (Cold)
**Parties**: Veinian Oligarchy vs. Pulse-Keepers
**Status**: Tense standoff

The Oligarchy wants to expand farming into Pulse Vent territories. The Pulse-Keepers refuse, calling it desecration. Both sides fund proxy conflicts through mercenary companies like [[Fading Blades]] and [[Dawn Company]].

> ⚔️ *No open war yet — but fields have burned, caravans have vanished, and both sides are arming.*

### The Hollow Breach (Active Crisis)
**Parties**: Marsh Wardens vs. Realm-Feeders
**Status**: Losing battle

Entropy Worms and Memory Eaters have broken through the Wardens' containment lines. Refugees are fleeing north. The Oligarchy debates whether to send aid — or to build walls.

> ⚠️ *If the Hollows fall, Memory Entropy will spread to the Heartlands within a generation.*

### The Imperial Remnant (Underground)
**Parties**: Remnant Church vs. everyone
**Status**: Secret insurgency

Cells of Imperial loyalists — including surviving Inquisitors — work to restore the "true faith." They assassinate scholars who teach the truth about [[The Pantheon]] and sabotage factions that have abandoned Imperial doctrine.

# Vornesthal — The Stone Kingdoms

> _"The Stone-Song Plains"_ — Land of endurance and scarcity

## Major Powers

### The Stone-Singer Confederation
**Capital**: [[Chorus Hall]]
**Government**: Tribal confederation with rotating leadership
**Philosophy**: The Stone-Song guides us

A loose alliance of tribes who live among the Singing Pillars. They interpret the pillars' harmonic drones as divine messages. Each tribe has autonomy, but they unite against external threats.

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Unity through shared faith | Disagreement over interpretation of Stone-Song |
| Hardy, self-sufficient people | Limited resources, no luxury goods |
| Knowledge of the canyons | Isolationist — few outside alliances |

### The Salt Lords of Karveth
**Capital**: [[Whitesalt]]
**Government**: Oligarchic merchant-lords
**Philosophy**: Salt preserves everything — including power

Controllers of the Salt Flats, the only reliable source of preservation salt in Qxartia. This makes them essential to trade — and despised for their prices. They are ruthless capitalists.

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Monopoly on preservation salt | Universally hated |
| Extreme wealth | Small military |
| Trade leverage over all factions | Memory Entropy affecting workers |

### The Deep-Dweller Clans
**Capital**: [[Sporecrown]]
**Government**: Matriarchal council
**Philosophy**: The deep provides

Subterranean peoples who have lived in the Fungal Underdark for millennia. They harvest mana-fungi and trade with surface dwellers. They distrust outsiders but honor ancient agreements.

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Control of mana-fungi supply | Vulnerable to surface politics |
| Immune to surface Entropy effects | Sensory Entropy affecting deep communities |
| Ancient knowledge of the Underdark | Declining birth rates |

---

## Current Conflicts in Vornesthal

### The Salt Embargo (Active)
**Parties**: Salt Lords vs. Stone-Singer Confederation
**Status**: Economic warfare

The Salt Lords raised prices. The Confederation refused to pay. Now the Stone-Singers are rationing — and some tribes talk of taking Whitesalt by force.

> ⚔️ *If the Confederation attacks, every faction dependent on salt will be drawn in.*

### The Deep Plague (Growing Threat)
**Parties**: Deep-Dweller Clans vs. unknown
**Status**: Epidemic

Something is killing mana-fungi at the source. Entire caverns have gone dark. The Deep-Dwellers don't know the cause — but some whisper of Pattern Parasites rewriting the fungi's growth patterns.

> 🌑 *If the mana-fungi die, Vornesthal loses its primary magical resource.*

### The Pillar Schism (Religious Conflict)
**Parties**: Stone-Singer tribes
**Status**: Internal division

Two tribes interpret the Stone-Song differently — one hears a warning of coming doom, the other hears a promise of renewal. The Confederation's unity is fracturing.

# Kthrimvey — The Whispering Courts

> _"The Whispering Woods"_ — Land of memory and mist

## Major Powers

### The Canopy Courts
**Capital**: [[Highbough]]
**Government**: Aristocratic houses
**Philosophy**: Tradition and beauty above all

An elven-dominated aristocracy living in the treetop villages of the Elder Canopy. They consider themselves the inheritors of Feywild culture and look down on groundlings. Politics is conducted through elaborate social games.

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Control of canopy resources and trade | Arrogant, alienate allies |
| Long-lived nobles with deep knowledge | Population is small and aging |
| Alliance with Feywild remnants | Vulnerable to Entropy — old memories fade |

### The Grove Keepers
**Capital**: [[Remembrance]]
**Government**: Monastic order
**Philosophy**: Memory must be preserved

A religious order dedicated to maintaining the Memory Groves and recording knowledge. They are politically neutral — or try to be. They accept memories from all factions and hold secrets that could destroy kingdoms.

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Vast knowledge archive | No military |
| Trusted as neutral arbiters | Holding dangerous secrets makes them targets |
| Understand Entropy better than anyone | Struggling to preserve knowledge as Entropy accelerates |

### The Root-Sea Nomads
**Capital**: None (mobile bands)
**Government**: Tribal elders
**Philosophy**: The forest floor is freedom

Humans, halflings, and outcasts who live in the Root-Sea below. They reject both Canopy aristocracy and Grove piety. They're traders, scavengers, and occasionally bandits.

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Knowledge of Root-Sea ruins | No unified leadership |
| Mobile, hard to pin down | Considered criminals by Canopy Courts |
| Find artifacts others cannot reach | Vital Entropy claims many |

---

## Current Conflicts in Kthrimvey

### The Canopy-Root War (Simmering)
**Parties**: Canopy Courts vs. Root-Sea Nomads
**Status**: Raids and reprisals

The Canopy Courts want to "civilize" the Root-Sea. The Nomads want to be left alone. Bridges get cut, nobles get robbed, and the forest floor grows more dangerous each year.

> ⚔️ *A full war would be devastating — the Canopy cannot survive without Root-Sea trade.*

### The Great Forgetting (Accelerating Crisis)
**Parties**: Everyone vs. Entropy
**Status**: Existential threat

Memory Entropy is accelerating. The oldest Memory Groves are failing. The Grove Keepers are losing records faster than they can copy them. Soon, no one will remember the true history of [[The Pantheon]] at all.

> ⚠️ *The Grove Keepers estimate that within 50 years, all pre-Severing knowledge will be lost forever.*

### The Mist Cults (Underground)
**Parties**: Various cults vs. established factions
**Status**: Growing

In the Mist Hollows, strange cults have emerged — worshipping voices that echo back. Some believe these are the dead. Others believe they are something older. The cults are recruiting the desperate.

# Cross-Continental Conflicts

## The Entropy War (All Continents)
Every faction is fighting Entropy — but they disagree on how:
- **Veinian Oligarchy**: Exploit resources faster before they decay
- **Pulse-Keepers**: Protect sacred sites, accept gradual loss
- **Salt Lords**: Sell preservation at premium prices
- **Grove Keepers**: Record everything before it's forgotten

> 🌑 *Entropy doesn't negotiate. But factions fight over who gets to decide how the world dies.*

## The Trade Wars (Economic)
With no Empire to regulate trade, every faction sets its own rules:
- Salt is controlled by Karveth
- Mana-fungi by the Deep-Dwellers
- Food by the Veinian Oligarchy
- Memory-wood by Kthrimvey

Alliances form and break over tariffs, embargoes, and assassination.

## The Inquisition Underground (Secret)
Remnant Inquisitors operate across all continents, working to:
- Assassinate scholars who teach about The Pantheon
- Recover and hide Pantheon artifacts
- Infiltrate the Grove Keepers to destroy records
- Prepare for the Empire's eventual restoration

> ⚠️ *They are few, but they are patient. They have been waiting 200 years.*
