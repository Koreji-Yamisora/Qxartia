# The Canopy Proclamations
_Official Decrees and Historical Record of the Canopy Courts_

> ⚠️ **READER WARNING**: This document represents the aristocratic perspective of the [[Canopy Courts]]. It contains significant class bias and altitude-based prejudice.

## Proclamation the First: On Natural Order

*Issued by Sky-Regent Velorian the Wise, Year 912*

Let it be known that the order of the world is vertical.

The sun rises from above. Rain falls from above. The [[Elder Canopy]] reaches toward the sky. Those who dwell in height dwell in truth; those who grovel in dirt have chosen their station.

The Canopy Courts do not oppress the people of the Root-Sea. We merely acknowledge what nature has already declared: **some are meant to rise, and some are meant to remain**.

## Proclamation the Second: On the War of Borders

*Issued following the First Accords, Year 1104*

The recent unpleasantness was not of our making.

The [[Root-Sea Nomads]] forgot their place. They cut bridges that were ours by right. They dared to reach upward when their purpose is to crawl.

We restored order. The bridges were rebuilt. The natural arrangement was preserved.

History will record that we defended not ourselves, but the principle of hierarchy itself. Future generations will thank us.

## Proclamation the Third: On the Entropy Schism

*Issued by Voice Selorian III, Year 1580*

The Courts take no position on whether [[Entropy]] should be fought or accepted.

This is because the question does not truly affect us.

We record memories properly. We do not cling to dying soil. We have risen above the decay that consumes those below. Let them fight about mud; we shall cultivate beauty.

*Nota bene*: We continue to fund the [[Marsh Wardens]] as a charitable gesture, not because we require their protection. Our altitude is our protection.

## Proclamation the Fourth: On the Descent Taboo

*Issued by the Canopy Concord, Year 1823*

Recent incidents have required clarification of long-standing custom.

To **descend** — to voluntarily touch the forest floor — is to declare oneself no longer part of the Courts. This is not punishment; it is recognition of choice.

Those who descend may return. They may even live among us again. But they will be **Groundlings** — a reminder that choices have consequences.

No child born above should fear the ground. But they should understand: down there, memory fades, form dissolves, and purpose is forgotten. We rise because we do not wish to share that fate.

## Proclamation the Fifth: On Trade with Lower Peoples

*Issued by the Concord Trade Commission, ongoing*

The [[Root-Sea Nomads]] provide valuable salvage and labor. We acknowledge their usefulness.

This acknowledgment does not imply equality.

We purchase their goods at fair market prices. We employ their workers at competitive wages. We treat them with the dignity appropriate to their station — which is considerable, for those who live in muck.

Some call this exploitation. We call it civilization doing what civilization does: providing structure to those who would otherwise have none.

---

## On Record-Keeping

The Canopy Courts have maintained continuous historical records for over 1,200 years — longer than any other kingdom except perhaps the [[Grove Keepers]] (though trees are not proper archives).

We remember because we rise. We rise because we remember.

Let the ground-dwellers forget. Their forgetting is not our concern.

*Signed and sealed by the voice of the Sky-Regent,*
*Highbough, Year 2203 of the Accurate Calendar*
