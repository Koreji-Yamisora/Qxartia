# Warden's Remembrance
_Personal Accounts from the Marsh Border_

> ⚠️ **READER WARNING**: This document compiles testimonies from [[Marsh Wardens]]. It reflects their lived experience, which is traumatic and may differ from official histories.

## Preface

*These accounts were collected by the Remembrancers of [[Hollowmarch]]. They are not edited for comfort. They are what our people remember — for as long as they can remember.*

## Account 1: The Walker's Warning

*Recorded from Warden-Scout Veylin, 17 years of service (3 years of memories remaining)*

They don't tell you what it's like.

The politicians in [[Veinia Prime]], the philosophers in [[Remembrance]], the priests in [[Breathlight]] — they write treatises about [[Entropy]]. They debate whether to "fight" or "accept."

I've watched the boundary move. Inch by inch, year by year. The trees go gray. The birds stop singing. And then people start wandering in — because the Marsh doesn't kill you. It just makes you forget you want to leave.

Yesterday I saw my commander speak to a Returner. He called him by name. The Returner stared through him. Didn't recognize the man who'd trained him for twenty years.

That's Entropy. That's what they're debating about accepting.

## Account 2: On the War of Borders

*Recorded from Warden-General Osrik Vane (19 years of memories lost)*

The War of Borders.

I remember... parts of it. I remember we defended a line. I remember the [[Stone-Singer Confederation]] sent troops. I remember the [[Veinian Oligarchy]] sent supplies — but fewer than promised.

I don't remember my rank at the time. I don't remember my commanding officer's name. I know I had one because everyone does.

What I remember clearly: while they fought over farmland, the Marsh took three villages. Nobody rescued them. Nobody even noticed.

When the war ended, the [[First Accords]] mentioned us in one paragraph. One paragraph for the front line against the thing that's eating the world.

## Account 3: On the Entropy Schism

*Recorded from Remembrancer Lyssa (no memory loss — yet)*

I archive everything. Every Warden who comes through here, I record their name, their face, their voice, their story. Before they forget. Before they become someone else.

During the Schism, people came here to argue.

The Activists said: "Support us. You fight Entropy every day. You know it can be fought."

The Accepters said: "Support us. You see Entropy every day. You know it cannot be beaten."

The Warden-General at the time — I don't remember her name; was it Karith? Karis? — she told both groups the same thing:

*"We don't have time for philosophy. We're busy trying not to forget our own faces."*

## Account 4: Why We Stay

*Recorded from Border-Captain Maren, 8 years of service (full memories retained)*

My grandmother was a Warden. She served forty years. By the end, she couldn't remember my mother's name — her own daughter.

I asked her once, when I was young: "Why did you do it? Why did you let the Marsh take your memories?"

She said: "Because someone has to stand there. And if I don't, who will?"

I enlisted the next week.

Some people think we're heroes. We're not. We're just the ones who couldn't bear to walk away.

## Account 5: A Message to the Kingdoms

*Compiled from multiple testimonies*

To the [[Veinian Oligarchy]]: Your grain feeds us. We're grateful. Now feed us more. We die so you can profit.

To the [[Pulse-Keepers]]: Your prayers don't work here. Send mages instead.

To the [[Canopy Courts]]: You can't climb high enough to escape Entropy. It will reach you eventually. Remember that when you look down at us.

To the [[Grove Keepers]]: We understand your philosophy. We do. Some days, acceptance sounds like peace. But we can't accept. Not yet. Maybe not ever. Because if we accept, the Marsh wins.

And to everyone else: We remember. For as long as we can. We hold the line where memory ends.

*Don't forget us before we forget ourselves.*
