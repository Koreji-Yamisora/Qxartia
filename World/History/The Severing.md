## What Common Folk Believe (The Fallen Holy Empire's Version)

> *The official doctrine taught in temples and schools across [[Qxartia]]:*

There was no "Severing." There was only **God's Will**.

[[Selamonius|God]] created the world perfect and whole. The planes have always been as they are now. Any tales of a "before time" or "the breaking" are heretical nonsense spread by those who wish to undermine faith.

The heavens are silent because God watches and waits. The faithful need no miracles — only obedience.

> ⚠️ *"Question not the silence of heaven. God speaks through scripture, not spectacle."*

## What Actually Happened (The Forbidden Truth)

> *Pieced together from the Lithic Tablets, the Canopy Scrolls, and whispered fragments:*

In an age before mortal memory, the planes were bound together in an ancient structure — a **tree-like cosmology** where all realms connected through pathways of divine power. [[The Pantheon]] walked between planes freely. Mortals could, with great effort, reach [[The Celestial]] through [[The Feywild]].

Then came **The Severing**.

## The Fall of the Pantheon

One by one, the gods of [[The Pantheon]] fell — or vanished, or were destroyed. No account agrees on what happened:

| Theory | Source |
|--------|--------|
| They killed each other in war | The Lithic Tablets of [[Vornesthal]] |
| Something hunted them | The Canopy Scrolls of [[Kthrimvey]] |
| They sacrificed themselves for a purpose unknown | The Book of Forgotten Names |
| [[Selamonius]] destroyed them | Heretical whispers |

Only [[Selamonius]] survived — and she has not spoken since.

## The Restructuring of the Planes

When the last Pantheon god fell, the bonds holding the planes together **shattered**.

### What Changed

| Before The Severing | After The Severing |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Planes bound in a tree-like structure | Planes drift freely in the **World Axis** |
| [[The Celestial]] connected via the Feywild | The Celestial is **severed** — no path remains |
| Elemental and energy planes distinct | Collapsed into **[[The Elemental Chaos]]** |
| Divine pathways open | All pathways **closed** |

### The World Axis Emerged

From the chaos of the Severing, a new cosmological structure stabilized:

- **[[The Astral Sea]]** formed "above" — a silvery void where [[astral dominions]] now drift, including the severed Celestial
- **[[The Elemental Chaos]]** formed "below" — a tempestuous realm where elemental forces and [[The Abyss]] churn
- **[[The Feywild]]** and **[[The Shadowfell]]** remained as parallel planes, echoes of the [[Material Plane]]

> 💡 *The World Axis is not how the planes were always meant to be. It is what remains after something terrible broke everything.*

## Effects on Magic

The Severing caused catastrophic magical disruption:

| Effect | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **Divine silence** | Gods no longer answer prayers directly |
| **Planar instability** | Some areas of [[Qxartia]] still twist with unhealed rifts |
| **Wild magic zones** | Where the old bonds snapped, magic behaves unpredictably |
| **Lost spells** | Magic that relied on the old planar structure ceased to function |

Some scholars believe [[Entropy]]'s acceleration began with the Severing — that the slow forgetting is the wound left by this cosmic trauma.

## When Did It Happen?

No one knows precisely. The Severing predates mortal record-keeping — or the [[Fallen Holy Empire]] destroyed those records.

Estimates range from:
- **Ten thousand years ago** — based on geological evidence
- **Time immemorial** — some believe it happened before time itself was fixed
- **Recently, but memory was erased** — a paranoid minority theory

> 🌑 *"The Severing is the wound. [[Entropy]] is the blood. [[Qxartia]] is dying of an injury it cannot remember receiving."*
> — Anonymous heretic

## What the Archfey Remember

The oldest [[Archfey]] of [[The Feywild]] remember *something*. They speak of:

- A sky that *cracked*
- Divine voices that suddenly went **silent**
- The Feywild shaking for what felt like centuries
- The path to [[The Celestial]] closing like a door slamming shut

They do not speak of it willingly. When pressed, they change the subject — or worse.
