# The Entropy Schism
_The Theological War_

## Overview

The Entropy Schism was not primarily a war of territory but a war of **philosophy**: Should [[Qxartia]] fight [[Entropy]], or accept it as the natural order? This question split families, religions, and kingdoms — and its echoes still shape politics today.

## The Two Factions

### The Activists
Those who believed Entropy could and should be resisted:

| Supporter | Reasoning |
|-----------|-----------|
| [[Marsh Wardens]] | "We fight it daily. Of course it can be fought." |
| [[Salt Lords of Karveth]] | "Our salt slows decay. With more resources, we can slow it more." |
| [[Veinian Oligarchy]] | "Our crops decay. Give us tools to stop it." |
| [[Deep-Dweller Clans]] | "Underground, we've slowed it. The surface can too." |

### The Accepters
Those who believed Entropy was natural and necessary:

| Supporter | Reasoning |
|-----------|-----------|
| [[Grove Keepers]] | "The trees accept. The memories accept. So must we." |
| [[Pulse-Keepers]] (majority) | "The Pulse includes exhalation AND fading. Both are sacred." |
| [[Stone-Singer Confederation]] (some) | "The silent pillars teach: not all decay is loss." |
| [[Canopy Courts]] | "We remember properly because we do not cling. Accept and transcend." |

## Key Events

| ~1530 | [[Pulse-Keepers]] fracture: Dawn Orthodoxy (Accept) vs Night Reform (Activist) |
| ~1550 | First violence: Activist mob burns a Grove Keeper monastery |
| ~1560 | The **Shadow War** begins — assassinations, sabotage, proxy conflicts |

## The Shadow War

Unlike the War of Borders, the Schism was fought largely through:
- Assassination of prominent figures
- Economic sabotage (salt shipments intercepted, crops poisoned)
- Religious persecution (Night-Casters hunted; Accepter temples burned)
- Propaganda campaigns

## Kingdom Perspectives

### [[Grove Keepers]] — Accepter View
> *"We did not start this war. We simply said: let go. They could not bear the thought of letting go. They called our peace 'surrender.' They burned our libraries. We forgave them — and gave their guilt to the trees."*

### [[Marsh Wardens]] — Activist View
> *"We die on that border every day. We forget our families, our names, our lives — so that others can philosophize about 'accepting' what's eating our friends. The Accepters have never smelled the Hollow Marshes. They've never watched someone they love forget their own face."*

### [[Pulse-Keepers]] — Internal Division
> *"The Schism nearly destroyed us. Brother against brother. Dawn against Night. We healed — barely — by declaring both truths compatible. The Pulse gives AND takes. We fight AND accept. This is the fragile compromise we tell ourselves."*

## Legacy: The Treaty of Silence

The war ended with a treaty that essentially said: *we will not discuss this anymore*.

- Both philosophies are officially tolerated
- No kingdom may force its view on another
- The [[Marsh Wardens]] receive funding regardless of philosophical position
- The topic is avoided in diplomatic settings

The result: simmering resentment, unresolved grief, and a question that still has no answer.
