## Overview

While [[Mercenary Companies]] handle military operations, the **Adventurer Guilds** serve individuals and small groups: escorting merchants, clearing monster infestations, recovering lost artifacts, or simply surviving journeys too dangerous for ordinary travelers.

Each continent has its own guild system, adapted to local conditions.

## The Three Continental Guilds

### The Pulse-Runners Guild (Zytharkraen)
_"Timing is survival."_

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Headquarters** | [[Veinia Prime]] |
| **Philosophy** | Work with the land's rhythms, not against them |
| **Specialty** | Fast-decay goods transport, Pulse-timed missions |
| **Notable** | Only guild with [[Marsh Warden]] liaison officers |

The Pulse-Runners understand that in [[Zytharkraen]], everything is temporary. They specialize in missions that require precise timing: delivering goods before they decay, extracting people from entropy zones before memories fade, and coordinating with the [[Pulse-Keepers]]' schedules.

**Common Quests:**
- Harvest escort (high-value, short window)
- Marsh-edge reconnaissance
- Decay-zone recovery
- Night-caster tracking (CONTROVERSIAL)

---

### The Stone-Walkers Guild (Vornesthal)
_"Every echo guides us."_

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Headquarters** | [[Chorus Hall]] |
| **Philosophy** | Listen to the land; it tells you what it needs |
| **Specialty** | Underground navigation, cave operations, pillar-field work |
| **Notable** | Strong ties to [[Stone-Singer Confederation]] |

The Stone-Walkers are the preeminent adventurers of [[Vornesthal]] — skilled in navigating the [[Singing Pillars]], the [[Fungal Underdark]], and the dangerous canyon networks. They train members to navigate by sound and survive on minimal resources.

**Common Quests:**
- Caravan escort through pillar-fields
- Deep cave exploration
- Mana-fungi harvesting (dangerous variety)
- Lost expedition recovery

---

### The Mist-Striders Guild (Kthrimvey)
_"The forest lets you pass — if it approves."_

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Headquarters** | No fixed location (rotates with [[Root-Sea Nomads]]) |
| **Philosophy** | Move with the flow; fighting the forest is suicide |
| **Specialty** | Forest survival, memory-zone operations, ruin delving |
| **Notable** | Only guild with active [[Canopy Courts]] membership (contested) |

The Mist-Striders are the most unusual of the three guilds — they have no permanent headquarters, no rigid hierarchy, and no standard uniform. They follow the forest's rhythms, collaborate with [[Root-Sea Nomads]], and venture into places the [[Canopy Courts]] consider beneath notice.

**Common Quests:**
- Root-Sea ruin exploration
- Memory Grove pilgrim escort
- Mist Hollow mapping (extremely dangerous)
- "Canopy extraction" (rescuing Groundlings — discreet)

## Universal Ranking System

All three guilds use a shared ranking system to facilitate cross-continental operations:

| Rank | Symbol | Typical Quests |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Iron** | ⬛ | Local escort, pest control, simple deliveries |
| **Bronze** | 🟫 | Regional travel, minor monster hunting, guarding |
| **Silver** | ⬜ | Dangerous environments, significant combat, special skills |
| **Gold** | 🟨 | Elite missions, kingdom-level contracts, extreme danger |
| **Mythril** | 💎 | Legendary status — entropy zones, inter-continental, politically sensitive |

### Advancement Requirements

| From | To | Requirements |
|------|-----|--------------|
| Iron | Bronze | 20 completed quests, guild endorsement |
| Bronze | Silver | 50 quests, specialty certification, combat evaluation |
| Silver | Gold | 100 quests, leadership experience, letters of recommendation |
| Gold | Mythril | By nomination only; requires extraordinary service |

---

## Guild Halls

Major cities maintain **Guild Halls** — combined barracks, taverns, and job boards:

| City | Guild Hall Name |
|------|-----------------|
| [[Veinia Prime]] | The Runner's Rest |
| [[Breathlight]] | Dawn's Edge |
| [[Hollowmarch]] | The Last Light |
| [[Chorus Hall]] | The Echo Chamber |
| [[Sporecrown]] | The Glowing Board |
| [[Whitesalt]] | The Salt & Sword |
| [[Highbough]] | The Branch Office |
| [[Remembrance]] | The Pilgrim's Post |
