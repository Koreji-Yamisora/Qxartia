# Mercenary Companies of Qxartia
_Those who sell their swords in a decaying world_

## Overview

In [[Qxartia]], violence is rarely the greatest threat — [[Entropy]] is. But there are always wars, bandits, monsters, and expeditions into dangerous territory. For these needs, the mercenary companies exist.

Unlike [[Adventurer Guilds]], mercenary companies are **organizations-for-hire** rather than individual contractors. They take on military operations, guarding, and the jobs too large or too bloody for lone adventurers.

## The Major Companies

### The Fading Blades
_"We remember what we kill."_

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Specialty** | Entropy-zone operations |
| **Base** | [[Hollowmarch]], but mobile |
| **Reputation** | Grim professionals; high casualty rate |
| **Notable** | Work closely with [[Marsh Wardens]] |

The Fading Blades are the only company that operates regularly in the [[Hollow Marshes]]. Their members accept that they will lose memories — names of loved ones, childhood homes, old friendships. They tattoo their most important facts on their bodies. They are paid extremely well, and rarely live to spend it.

**Services:**
- Entropy-zone escort and recovery
- Artifact retrieval from decayed areas
- Marsh creature elimination
- Terminal memory missions (what you forget, they do)

### The Pillar Stalkers
_"Every stone has a shadow."_

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Specialty** | Canyon and cave warfare |
| **Base** | [[Vornesthal]], mobile camps |
| **Reputation** | Silent, deadly, expensive |
| **Notable** | Rumored connections to [[Deep-Dweller Clans]] |

The Pillar Stalkers are masters of the harsh terrain of [[Vornesthal]] — the canyons, caves, and pillar fields where sound and light behave strangely. They're the company you hire when you need something done underground or in vertical environments.

**Services:**
- Underground escort through the [[Fungal Underdark]]
- Canyon bandit elimination
- Pillar-field navigation
- "Consultation" for the [[Salt Lords of Karveth]]

### The Shadowleaf Company
_"The forest fights with us."_

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Specialty** | Forest and treetop operations |
| **Base** | [[Kthrimvey]], no fixed location |
| **Reputation** | Elusive, eccentric, terrifyingly effective |
| **Notable** | Many members are former [[Root-Sea Nomads]] |

The Shadowleaf Company fights in the forests of [[Kthrimvey]] — a terrain that confuses outsiders and swallows armies. They use the [[Mist Hollows]] as weapons, drive enemies into the Root-Sea, and vanish into the Canopy.

**Services:**
- Forest escort and protection
- Anti-[[Canopy Courts]] operations (discreet)
- Ruin recovery from the Root-Sea
- Making problems "disappear into the mist"

---

### The Dawn Company
_"Strike with the first light."_

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Specialty** | Timing-based combat |
| **Base** | [[Breathlight]] (officially; actually mobile) |
| **Reputation** | Religious zealots or tactical geniuses, depending who you ask |
| **Notable** | Informally aligned with [[Pulse-Keepers]] |

The Dawn Company believes that timing is everything — and they're right. Their mages coordinate attacks with the Pulse, their equipment is charged at dawn, and their contracts include precise schedules. They refuse night operations on principle.

**Services:**
- [[Veinian Oligarchy]] contract enforcement
- [[Pulse-Keepers]] defensive operations
- Timed precision strikes
- Sunrise-scheduled executions

---

### The Grief Merchants
_"Everyone pays eventually."_

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Specialty** | Debt collection and enforcement |
| **Base** | [[Whitesalt]] |
| **Reputation** | Cruel, effective, connected to [[Salt Lords of Karveth]] |
| **Notable** | Use psychological warfare as primary tool |

The Grief Merchants are not soldiers — they're collectors. When debts go unpaid, when contracts are broken, when someone needs to be reminded that obligations have consequences, the Grief Merchants arrive. They prefer intimidation to violence, but they're capable of both.

**Services:**
- Debt collection across all kingdoms
- Contract enforcement
- "Negotiation assistance"
- The kind of work no one admits to hiring

## Mercenary Rankings

Most companies use similar internal rankings:

| Rank | Role |
|------|------|
| **Sword** | Basic soldier |
| **Blade** | Experienced fighter, specialist |
| **Captain** | Unit leader |
| **Marshal** | Senior officer |
| **Commander** | Company leadership |

---

## Hiring a Company

| Factor | Effect on Price |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Danger level** | Higher danger = higher pay |
| **Duration** | Longer contracts have discounts |
| **Exclusivity** | Sole-contractor agreements cost more |
| **Entropy exposure** | Any [[Hollow Marshes]] work triples the cost |
| **Moral flexibility** | Unethical jobs cost more (or less, depending on company) |
