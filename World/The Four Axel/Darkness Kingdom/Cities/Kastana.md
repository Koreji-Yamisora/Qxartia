## The Border: Nightmare Forest

At the border between Kastana and **Opaque Astra** lies a nightmarish forest filled with dangerous monsters:

| Creature | Threat |
|----------|--------|
| **Ogres** | Brute strength, territorial |
| **Kelpies** | Water spirits that drown the unwary |
| **Banshees** | Their screams herald death |
| *Others* | Countless horrors lurk in the dark |

## The Inner Problem

Despite its beauty, Kastana harbors a dark secret: **slavery**.

This is the city's greatest shame — an institution that ruler [[Kami Yami]] is actively working to dismantle. With help from [[Victus]]'s leader, she has improved security and quality of life for her citizens, but the path to reform is long.

> *The people still have faith that their young leader could overwrite the bad reputation and mend relationships with other kingdoms.*
