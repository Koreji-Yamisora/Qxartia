## Overview

The Darkness Kingdom is a realm of perpetual gloom — the sky always heavy, as if rain is moments away but never falls. Led by a young ruler rumored to be a tyrant who made a **pact with one of the 7 Demon Lords**, this kingdom carries the weight of its dark reputation.

Yet beneath the rumors lies a more complex truth: a young leader struggling to reform a broken system, to mend relationships with other kingdoms, and to overwrite the sins of her predecessors.
