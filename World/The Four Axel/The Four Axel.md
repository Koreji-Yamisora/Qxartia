## Overview

The Four Axel is one of the continents within [[The Void]] — the liminal space between Alternate Universes. Unlike [[Qxartia]], which exists in a single reality, The Four Axel floats in the space-between, where time moves slower and the boundaries of self blur.

This continent consists of **four kingdoms**, each embodying a different aspect of existence:

| Kingdom | Domain |
|---------|--------|
| [[Darkness Kingdom]] | Shadow, secrets, and the weight of past sins |
| [[Light Kingdom]] | *Details to come* |
| [[Dream Kingdom]] | *Details to come* |
| [[Hope Kingdom]] | *Details to come* |

---

## Current Conflict

The four kingdoms exist in a state of **fragile tension**. Disagreements have erupted among the rulers over the actions of the **former leader of the Darkness Kingdom** — sins of the past that still poison the present.

Alliances are forming. Lines are being drawn.

## Magic in The Four Axel

The Four Axel uses the same [[Mana]] system as the wider multiverse:

- **Mana** appears as purple, translucent particles in the air
- Creatures carry magic in their **blood** — the more purple the blood, the more mana capacity
- **Magic stones** can store and gather mana from the air
- **Pacts with higher beings** combine your magical capacity with theirs

## The Void's Effect

Because The Four Axel exists within [[The Void]]:

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Time Dilation** | 1 hour here = 1 minute in the real world |
| **Alternate Selves** | You may encounter alternate versions of yourself — many rulers have seen their own alternates walking the streets |
| **Refuge** | Many use The Void (and The Four Axel) as a place to rest and recover |

## The Kingdoms

### [[Darkness Kingdom]]
Led by a young ruler rumored to be a tyrant who made a pact with one of the **7 Demon Lords**. The land is perpetually gloomy, as if rain is always about to fall. Seven cities comprise this kingdom, with the island of **Vainglory** serving as a prison for the worst criminals.
