## Overview

Trade in [[Qxartia]] is a constant battle against [[Entropy]]. Goods decay. Mana fades. The routes themselves shift as the land forgets its shape. Despite this, a complex network of trade paths connects the three supercontinents and their kingdoms.

## Currency

### The Problem of Decay

Money in Qxartia faces unique challenges:
- Metal coins corrode over decades
- Paper currency fades
- Mana-backed currency loses value as mana decays

### Common Currencies

| Currency | Used By | Backing |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Seed-marks** | [[Veinian Oligarchy]] | Future harvests |
| **Stone-chips** | [[Stone-Singer Confederation]] | Pillar-dust reserves |
| **Salt-weights** | [[Salt Lords of Karveth]] | Preservation salt |
| **Memory-tokens** | [[Grove Keepers]] | Recorded memories |
| **Glow-notes** | [[Deep-Dweller Clans]] | Mana-fungi value |

### The Salt Standard

Most inter-kingdom trade uses **salt-weights** as a universal currency, since preservation salt is the most stable store of value in a world of decay.
