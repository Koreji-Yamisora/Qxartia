## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The frog can breathe air and water.

***Standing Leap.*** The frog's [Long Jump](compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-jump-xphb.md) is up to 20 feet and its [High Jump](compendium/rules/variant-rules/high-jump-xphb.md) is up to 10 feet with or without a running start.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +3, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) Piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [Grappled](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 11).

***Swallow.*** The frog swallows a Small or smaller target it is grappling. While swallowed, the target isn't [Grappled](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) but has the [Blinded](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [Restrained](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) conditions, and it has [Total Cover](compendium/rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md) against attacks and other effects outside the frog. While swallowing the target, the frog can't use Bite, and if the frog dies, the swallowed target is no longer [Restrained](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting with the [Prone](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition.

At the end of the frog's next turn, the swallowed target takes 5 (2d4) Acid damage. If that damage doesn't kill it, the frog disgorges it, causing it to exit [Prone](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
