## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The toad can breathe air and water.

***Standing Leap.*** The toad's [Long Jump](compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-jump-xphb.md) is up to 20 feet and its [High Jump](compendium/rules/variant-rules/high-jump-xphb.md) is up to 10 feet with or without a running start.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +4, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) Piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) Poison damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [Grappled](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 12).

***Swallow.*** The toad swallows a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. While swallowed, the target isn't [Grappled](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) but has the [Blinded](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [Restrained](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) conditions, and it has [Total Cover](compendium/rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md) against attacks and other effects outside the toad. In addition, the target takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage at the end of each of the toad's turns. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time, and it can't use Bite while it has a swallowed target. If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [Restrained](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting with the [Prone](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition.
