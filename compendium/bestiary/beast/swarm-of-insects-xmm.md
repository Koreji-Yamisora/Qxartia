## Animals

For example, the [Panther](compendium/bestiary/beast/panther-xmm.md) stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [Giant Goat](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-goat-xmm.md) stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.

The swarm can't regain [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or gain [Temporary Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md).
