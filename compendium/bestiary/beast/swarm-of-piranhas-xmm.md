## Traits

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny piranha. The swarm can't regain [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or gain [Temporary Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md).

***Water Breathing.*** The swarm can breathe only underwater.

## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5 (with [Advantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) if the target doesn't have all its [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md)), reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 8 (2d4 + 3) Piercing damage, or 5 (1d4 + 3) Piercing damage if the swarm is [Bloodied](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Bloodied).
