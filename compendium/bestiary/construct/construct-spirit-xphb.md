***Slam.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* Bonus equals your spell attack modifier, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 1d8 + 4 + the spell's level Bludgeoning damage.

## Reactions

***Berserk Lashing (Clay Only).*** Trigger: The spirit takes damage from a creature. _Response:_ The spirit makes a Slam attack against that creature if possible, or the spirit moves up to half its Speed toward that creature without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](compendium/rules/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack).
