## Shadow Dragons

*Dragon Corrupted by Darkness*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Shadowfell), Underdark  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Shadow dragons haunt forgotten, lightless places. While they might have once been other types of dragons, the influence of planar forces, negative energy, or sinister magic has stripped them of their former color or luster. In place of any former breath weapon, shadow dragons exhale caliginous gouts that saps life from everything it touches. Those slain by a shadow dragon's breath rise as shades obedient to the shadow dragon's will.

Shadow dragons typically dwell in the Underdark, particularly in areas with connections to the Shadowfell or other tenebrous realms. In some cases, they might lurk in dark, corrupted reaches of the regions they preferred before transforming into shadow dragons. Overgrown swamps, sepulchral desert ruins, and ash-choked volcanoes make natural lairs for shadow dragons.

Like many other dragons, shadow dragons collect hoards. Their tastes tend to be morbid—collecting coins from ruined empires and their victims' skulls.

### Shadow Dragon Lairs

Shadow dragons lair in places of darkness and despair, such as accursed ruins, the depths of the Underdark, or the Shadowfell.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Living Shadow.*** While in [Dim Light](compendium/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) or [Darkness](compendium/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md), the dragon has [Resistance](compendium/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to damage that isn't Force, Psychic, or Radiant.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the dragon has [Disadvantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on ability checks and attack rolls.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three Rend attacks.

***Rend.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +10, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) Slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) Necrotic damage.

***Shadow Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 17, each creature in a 60-foot [Cone](compendium/rules/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md). *Failure:* 35 (10d6) Necrotic damage. *Success:* Half damage. *Failure or Success:* A Humanoid reduced to 0 [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) by this damage dies, and a [Shadow](compendium/bestiary/undead/shadow-xmm.md) rises from the corpse. The shadow is under the dragon's control and shares the dragon's [Initiative](compendium/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) count but acts immediately after the dragon.

## Bonus Actions

***Shadow Stealth.*** While in [Dim Light](compendium/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) or [Darkness](compendium/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md), the dragon takes the Hide action.

## Legendary Actions

Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after another creature's turn, the shadow dragon can expend a use to take one of the following actions. The shadow dragon regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.

***Pounce.*** The dragon moves up to half its [Speed](compendium/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md), and it makes one Rend attack.

***Veil of Shadow.*** The dragon uses Shadow Stealth, and one creature of its choice that it can see within 10 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) Necrotic damage. The dragon can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.
