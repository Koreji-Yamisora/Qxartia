# Marid
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 203*  

## Marid

*Genie of the Water*

- **Habitat.** Coastal, Planar (Elemental Plane of Water), Underwater  
- **Treasure.** [Relics](compendium/tables/random-magic-items-relics.md)  

Marids surge with the power of the seas, using it to manipulate the waves or create water. These genies typically dwell in or near bodies of water. While gentle marids make homes amid springs, oases, and serene pools, tempestuous marids inhabit sea stacks, whirlpools, and treacherous coasts. Marids vary in appearance, their bodies reflecting the colors of the waves while distinctive fins and scales accent their features. Marids lend their powers and knowledge of the seas to those who defend the marids' watery realms or who offer them pleasing gifts. Marids appreciate rare aquatic treasures, such as colorful pearls, shell instruments, or delicacies from distant seas.

Marids hail from the Elemental Plane of Water, where they live in wondrous homes drifting amid the endless ocean. Among these is the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls—a coral sphere studded with dozens of domed theaters and libraries—and the air-filled, cosmopolitan City of Glass.

## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The marid can breathe air and water.

***Elemental Restoration.*** If the marid dies outside the Elemental Plane of Water, its body dissolves into brine, and it gains a new body in 1d4 days, reviving with all its [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) somewhere on the Plane of Water.

***Wishes.*** The marid has a 30 percent chance of knowing the [Wish](compendium/spells/wish-xphb.md) spell. If the marid knows it, the marid can cast it only on behalf of a non-genie creature who communicates a wish in a way the marid can understand. If the marid casts the spell for the creature, the marid suffers none of the spell's stress. Once the marid has cast it three times, the marid can't do so again for 365 days.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The marid makes three Aquatic Lash attacks.

***Aquatic Lash.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +10, reach 15 ft. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) Slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) Cold damage.

***Water Jet.*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 18, each creature in a 60-foot-long, 10-foot-wide [Line](compendium/rules/variant-rules/line-area-of-effect-xphb.md). *Failure:* 31 (9d6) Cold damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is pushed up to 20 feet straight away from the marid and has the [Prone](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition. *Success:* Half damage only.

***Spellcasting.*** The marid casts one of the following spells, requiring no Material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

**At will:** [Create or Destroy Water](compendium/spells/create-or-destroy-water-xphb.md), [Detect Evil and Good](compendium/spells/detect-evil-and-good-xphb.md), [Detect Magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic-xphb.md), [Purify Food and Drink](compendium/spells/purify-food-and-drink-xphb.md)

**1/day each:** [Control Water](compendium/spells/control-water-xphb.md), [Gaseous Form](compendium/spells/gaseous-form-xphb.md), [Invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility-xphb.md), [Plane Shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift-xphb.md), [Tongues](compendium/spells/tongues-xphb.md)
