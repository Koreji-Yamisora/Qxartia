# Sea Hag
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 271. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

## Sea Hag

*Hag of Despair and the Dismal Deep*

- **Habitat.** Coastal, Underwater  
- **Treasure.** [Arcana](compendium/tables/random-magic-items-arcana.md)  

Sea hags loathe peace and beauty. Bitter, jealous creatures, they spread chaos and undermine joy however they can, undertaking elaborate deceptions to sow discord for its own sake. The hags' true forms are supernaturally vile, and their baleful gazes can strike down creatures [frightened](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) by their appearance.

Sea hags cloak themselves in illusions to work their schemes. Roll on or choose a result from the Sea Hag Disguises table to inspire a sea hag's illusion and how they might use it to wreak chaos and destruction.

## Traits

***Coven Magic.*** While within 30 feet of at least two hag allies, the hag can cast one of the following spells, requiring no Material components, using the spell's normal casting time, and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 11): [Augury](compendium/spells/augury-xphb.md), [Find Familiar](compendium/spells/find-familiar-xphb.md), [Identify](compendium/spells/identify-xphb.md), [Locate Object](compendium/spells/locate-object-xphb.md), [Scrying](compendium/spells/scrying-xphb.md), or [Unseen Servant](compendium/spells/unseen-servant-xphb.md). The hag must finish a [Long Rest](compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md) before using this trait to cast that spell again.


***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.

***Vile Appearance.*** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 11, any Beast or Humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form. *Failure:* The target has the [Frightened](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition until the start of its next turn. *Success:* The target is immune to this hag's Vile Appearance for 24 hours.
