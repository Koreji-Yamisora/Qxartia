## Traits

***Diabolical Restoration.*** If the devil dies outside the Nine Hells, its body disappears in sulfurous smoke, and it gains a new body instantly, reviving with all its [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) somewhere in the Nine Hells.

***Magic Resistance.*** The devil has [Advantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The devil makes three attacks, using Searing Fork or Hurl Flame in any combination. It can replace one attack with a use of Infernal Tail.

***Searing Fork.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +10, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) Piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) Fire damage.

***Hurl Flame.*** *Ranged Attack Roll:* +8, range 150 ft. *Hit:* 26 (5d8 + 4) Fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it starts [burning](compendium/traps-hazards/burning-xphb.md).

***Infernal Tail.*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 17, one creature the devil can see within 10 feet. *Failure:* 10 (1d8 + 6) Necrotic damage, and the target receives an infernal wound if it doesn't have one. While wounded, the target loses 10 (3d6) [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) at the start of each of its turns. The wound closes after 1 minute, after a spell restores [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) to the target, or after the target or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to stanch the wound, doing so by succeeding on a DC 17 Wisdom ([Medicine](compendium/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check.
