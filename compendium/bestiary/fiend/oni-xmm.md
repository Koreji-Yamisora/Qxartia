## Oni

*Wickedness Drawn to the Wicked*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Urban  
- **Treasure.** [Armaments](compendium/tables/random-magic-items-armaments.md)  

Oni are elusive entities that inhabit dark forests and other wildernesses. By shape-shifting into the form of an innocent or moving invisibly, oni encroach on communities and lonely roads. They frequently harass people of faith, testing the limits of their piousness, or torment selfish people, punishing them for their wickedness. Wise communities often have guardian statues, annual rituals, or local superstitions meant to keep oni at bay. In rare cases, an oni might gradually befriend such communities and protect them from other threats for generations.

Oni torment villages that don't pay them or other supernatural forces respect. Roll on or choose a result from the Oni Troubles table to inspire how an oni menaces such communities.
