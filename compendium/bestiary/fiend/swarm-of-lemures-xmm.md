# Swarm of Lemures
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 194*  

When devils drive hosts of lemures into close proximity or when lemures compress into a single mass, a swarm forms and adopts a unified mind.

## Lemures

*Devils of Agony and Despair*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Nine Hells)  
- **Treasure.** None  

The least of all devils, lemures arise from wicked souls, their mortal memories scoured away. Only vague limbs and anguished features jut from these slurries of infernal proto-matter.

## Traits

***Hellish Restoration.*** If the swarm dies in the Nine Hells, it revives with all its [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) in 1d10 days unless it is killed by a creature under the effects of a [Bless](compendium/spells/bless-xphb.md) spell or its remains are sprinkled with Holy Water.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through an opening large enough for a Medium creature. The swarm can't regain [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or gain [Temporary Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The swarm makes two Vile Slime attacks.

***Vile Slime.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +4, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 11 (2d8 + 2) Poison damage, or 9 (2d6 + 2) Poison damage if the swarm is [Bloodied](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Bloodied).
