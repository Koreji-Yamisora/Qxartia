# Archpriest
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 248*  

By forging connections with divine beings and mastering mystical truths, archpriests become conduits for godly intentions and other supernatural forces. Their magic allows them to work wonders, whether to share the benevolence of their faiths or to vent divine wrath. Some archpriests attract vast followings as they claim to speak for divine forces, while others undertake personal spiritual journeys and seek to transcend mortal concerns.

Priests harness the power of faith to work miracles. These religious adherents are as diverse as the faiths they follow. Some obey gods and their servants, while others live by age-old creeds. Belief guides priests' actions and their magic, which they use to shape the world in line with their ideologies.
