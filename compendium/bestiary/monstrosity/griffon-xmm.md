# Griffon
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 159. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

## Griffon

*Majestic Hunter of Land and Sky*

- **Habitat.** Arctic, Coastal, Grassland, Hill, Mountain  
- **Treasure.** None  

Griffons combine the features of raptors and big cats—most commonly eagles and lions—and possess the precision and ferocity of such predators. Rarer breeds of griffons have the features of condors and panthers, while others resemble hawks and tigers. Regardless of their appearances, griffons are often associated with royalty and are widely called the Masters of Animals.

Countless tales surround griffons. Roll on or choose a result from the Griffon Tales table to inspire stories about them.

**Griffon Tales**

| 3 | Lay eggs with remarkable healing properties. |
| 4 | Prefer the taste of horses over all other prey. |
| 5 | Serve the first creature they see after hatching. |
| 6 | Won't attack those with royal blood. |
