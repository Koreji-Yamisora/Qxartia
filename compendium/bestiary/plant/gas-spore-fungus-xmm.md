# Gas Spore Fungus
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 125*  

Gas spores are floating, orbicular fungi with rhizome growths and protuberances that resemble the stalks and eyes of beholders. If destroyed, a gas spore explodes in a poisonous burst that can infect creatures and slay them in hours. Infected corpses spawn more gas spores that grow to full size in a matter of days.

## Traits

***Death Burst.*** The gas spore bursts when it dies. *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 10, each creature in a 20-foot [Emanation](compendium/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from the gas spore. *Failure:* The target takes 10 (3d6) Poison damage and has the [Poisoned](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for 1d12 hours. Unless the [Poisoned](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition is removed, the target dies at the end of that time and sprouts 2d4 Tiny Gas Spore Fungi (each with 1 [Hit Point](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md)). After 2d6 days, they become Large and have 13 [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md).

## Actions

***Tendril.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +0, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 3 (1d6) Poison damage, and the target has the [Poisoned](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition until the end of its next turn.
