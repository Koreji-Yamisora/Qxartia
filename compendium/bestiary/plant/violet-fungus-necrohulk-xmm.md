# Violet Fungus Necrohulk

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The necrohulk makes two Rotting Slam attacks.

***Rotting Slam.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +7, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* 9 (1d10 + 4) Bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) Necrotic damage.

***Spore Bomb (Recharge 5-6).*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 15, each creature in a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](compendium/rules/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point the necrohulk can see within 60 feet. *Failure:* 28 (8d6) Necrotic damage, and the target has the [Poisoned](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition until the start of the necrohulk's next turn. While [Poisoned](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned), the target can't regain [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). *Success:* Half damage only.

## Bonus Actions

***Absorb Body.*** *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 15, one Medium or Small creature the necrohulk can see within 5 feet. *Failure:* The target is pulled into the necrohulk's space and becomes grafted to its body. The necrohulk can have only one target grafted at a time.

While grafted, the target has the [Restrained](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition and [Disadvantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on Constitution saving throws. When the necrohulk moves, the grafted target moves with it. If the target dies while grafted, its body is destroyed, and the necrohulk regains 10 [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md).

The grafted target or a creature within 5 feet of the necrohulk can take an action to make a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer grafted and moves to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the necrohulk.
