# Demilich

## Demilich

*What Lies beyond Lichdom*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** [Arcana](compendium/tables/random-magic-items-arcana.md)  

A demilich is a skull harboring the remnants of a lich's wicked essence. If the burden of immortality overwhelms a lich, its consciousness turns inward as its body rots away. But if its remains are disturbed, a demilich rises. Demiliches usually appear as skulls adorned with gems or arcane sigils.

### Demilich Lairs

Demiliches jealously guard their deathtrap-laden sanctums. The most notorious of these is the Tomb of Horrors, lair of the infamous Acererak.
