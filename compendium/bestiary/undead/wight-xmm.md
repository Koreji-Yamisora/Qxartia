# Wight

## Wight

*Life-Leeching Corpse Warrior*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Planar (Shadowfell), Swamp, Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** [Armaments](compendium/tables/random-magic-items-armaments.md)  

Wights are the withered corpses of relentless warriors whose wickedness sustains them beyond death. Unlike mere zombies, they retain the memories and evil agendas they harbored in life.

After dying and returning from the grave, a wight continues its villainous ways, but it is now driven by a hunger for life. A wight drains living essence through its attacks. Humanoids slain by a wight's life-sapping grip reanimate a day later and serve the wight as obedient zombies.

Wights might return from the dead for a multitude of sinister reasons. Roll on or choose a result from the Wight Motives table to inspire why a wight plagues the living.

## Traits

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the wight has [Disadvantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on ability checks and attack rolls.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The wight makes two attacks, using Necrotic Sword or Necrotic Bow in any combination. It can replace one attack with a use of Life Drain.

***Necrotic Sword.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +4, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) Slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) Necrotic damage.

***Necrotic Bow.*** *Ranged Attack Roll:* +4, range 150/600 ft. *Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) Piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) Necrotic damage.

***Life Drain.*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 13, one creature within 5 feet. *Failure:* 6 (1d8 + 2) Necrotic damage, and the target's [Hit Point](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) maximum decreases by an amount equal to the damage taken.

A Humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a [Zombie](compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie-xmm.md) under the wight's control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more than twelve zombies under its control at a time.
