# Actor
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 202*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th; Charisma 13 or higher

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Impersonation.** While you're disguised as a real or fictional person, you have [Advantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Charisma ([Deception](compendium/rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Performance](compendium/rules/skills.md#Performance)) checks to convince others that you are that person.

**Mimicry.** You can mimic the sounds of other creatures, including speech. A creature that hears the mimicry must succeed on a Wisdom ([Insight](compendium/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check to determine the effect is faked (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier and [Proficiency Bonus](compendium/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md)).
