You gain the following benefits.

**Initiative Proficiency.** When you roll [Initiative](compendium/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md), you can add your [Proficiency Bonus](compendium/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md) to the roll.

**Initiative Swap.** Immediately after you roll [Initiative](compendium/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md), you can swap your [Initiative](compendium/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) with the [Initiative](compendium/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) of one willing ally in the same combat. You can't make this swap if you or the ally has the [Incapacitated](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition.
