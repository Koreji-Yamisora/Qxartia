# Boon of Energy Resistance
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 210*  

**Prerequisite**: 19th

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 30.

**Energy Resistances.** You gain [Resistance](compendium/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to two of the following damage types of your choice: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Necrotic, Poison, Psychic, Radiant, or Thunder. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md), you can change your choices.

**Energy Redirection.** When you take damage of one of the types chosen for the Energy Resistances benefit, you can take a [Reaction](compendium/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to direct damage of the same type toward another creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn't behind [Total Cover](compendium/rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md). If you do so, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and [Proficiency Bonus](compendium/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md)) or take damage equal to `2d12` plus your Constitution modifier.
