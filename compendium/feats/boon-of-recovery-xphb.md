# Boon of Recovery
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 211*  

**Prerequisite**: 19th

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 30.

**Last Stand.** When you would be reduced to 0 [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), you can drop to 1 [Hit Point](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) instead and regain a number of [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to half your [Hit Point](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) maximum. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).

**Recover Vitality.** You have a pool of ten d10s. As a [Bonus Action](compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can expend dice from the pool, roll those dice, and regain a number of [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to the roll's total. You regain all the expended dice when you finish a [Long Rest](compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).
