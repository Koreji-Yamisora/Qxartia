# Chef
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 202*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Constitution or Wisdom by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Cook's Utensils.** You gain proficiency with [Cook's Utensils](compendium/items/cooks-utensils-xphb.md) if you don't already have it.

**Replenishing Meal.** As part of a [Short Rest](compendium/rules/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md), you can cook special food if you have ingredients and [Cook's Utensils](compendium/items/cooks-utensils-xphb.md) on hand. You can prepare enough of this food for a number of creatures equal to 4 plus your [Proficiency Bonus](compendium/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md). At the end of the [Short Rest](compendium/rules/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md), any creature who eats the food and spends one or more Hit Dice to regain [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) regains an extra `1d8` [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md).

**Bolstering Treats.** With 1 hour of work or when you finish a [Long Rest](compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md), you can cook a number of treats equal to your [Proficiency Bonus](compendium/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md) if you have ingredients and [Cook's Utensils](compendium/items/cooks-utensils-xphb.md) on hand. These special treats last 8 hours after being made. A creature can use a [Bonus Action](compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to eat one of those treats to gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) equal to your [Proficiency Bonus](compendium/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md).
