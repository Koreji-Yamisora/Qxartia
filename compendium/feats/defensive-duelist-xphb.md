# Defensive Duelist
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 203*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th; Dexterity 13 or higher

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Parry.** If you're holding a Finesse weapon and another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can take a [Reaction](compendium/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to add your [Proficiency Bonus](compendium/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md) to your [Armor Class](compendium/rules/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb.md), potentially causing the attack to miss you. You gain this bonus to your AC against melee attacks until the start of your next turn.
