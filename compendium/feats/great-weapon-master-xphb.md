# Great Weapon Master
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 204*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th; Strength 13 or higher

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Heavy Weapon Mastery.** When you hit a creature with a weapon that has the [Heavy](compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy) property as part of the [Attack](compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on your turn, you can cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target. The extra damage equals your [Proficiency Bonus](compendium/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md).

**Hew.** Immediately after you score a [Critical Hit](compendium/rules/variant-rules/critical-hit-xphb.md) with a Melee weapon or reduce a creature to 0 [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) with one, you can make one attack with the same weapon as a [Bonus Action](compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md).
