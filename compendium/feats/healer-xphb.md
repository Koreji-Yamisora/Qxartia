# Healer
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 201*  

You gain the following benefits.

**Battle Medic.** If you have a [Healer's Kit](compendium/items/healers-kit-xphb.md), you can expend one use of it and tend to a creature within 5 feet of yourself as a [Utilize](compendium/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action. That creature can expend one of its [Hit Point Dice](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-point-dice-xphb.md), and you then roll that die. The creature regains a number of [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to the roll plus your [Proficiency Bonus](compendium/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md).

**Healing Rerolls.** Whenever you roll a die to determine the number of [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) you restore with a spell or with this feat's Battle Medic benefit, you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll.
