# Inspiring Leader
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 204*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th; Wisdom 13 or higher or 4th; Charisma 13 or higher

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Wisdom or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Bolstering Performance.** When you finish a [Short](compendium/rules/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md) or [Long Rest](compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md), you can give an inspiring performance: a speech, song, or dance. When you do so, choose up to six allies (which can include yourself) within 30 feet of yourself who witness the performance. The chosen creatures each gain [Temporary Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) equal to your character level plus the modifier of the ability you increased with this feat.
