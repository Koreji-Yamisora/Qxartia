**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Dexterity or Strength by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Pole Strike.** Immediately after you take the [Attack](compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action and attack with a [Quarterstaff](compendium/items/quarterstaff-xphb.md), a [Spear](compendium/items/spear-xphb.md), or a weapon that has the Heavy and Reach properties, you can use a [Bonus Action](compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon. The weapon deals Bludgeoning damage, and the weapon's damage die for this attack is a `d4`.
