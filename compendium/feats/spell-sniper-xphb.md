# Spell Sniper
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 208*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th; Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Bypass Cover.** Your attack rolls for spells ignore [Half Cover](compendium/rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md) and [Three-Quarters Cover](compendium/rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md).

**Casting in Melee.** Being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose [Disadvantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on your attack rolls with spells.

**Increased Range.** When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 10 feet and requires you to make an attack roll, you can increase the spell's range by 60 feet.
