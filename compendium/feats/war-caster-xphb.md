# War Caster
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 209*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th; Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Concentration.** You have [Advantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain [Concentration](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration).

**Reactive Spell.** When a creature provokes an [Opportunity Attack](compendium/rules/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack) from you by leaving your reach, you can take a [Reaction](compendium/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to cast a spell at the creature rather than making an [Opportunity Attack](compendium/rules/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack). The spell must have a casting time of one action and must target only that creature.

**Somatic Components.** You can perform the Somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a [Shield](compendium/items/shield-xphb.md) in one or both hands.
