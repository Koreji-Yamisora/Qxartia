# +2 Rod of the Pact Keeper
*Rod, rare (requires attunement by a warlock)*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

While holding this rod, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your Warlock spells.

In addition, you can regain one spell slot as a [Magic](compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action while holding the rod. You can't use this property again until you finish a [Long Rest](compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).
