# Arrow-Catching Shield
*Armor ([shield](compendium/items/shield-xphb.md)), rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

You gain a +2 bonus to [Armor Class](compendium/rules/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb.md) against ranged attack rolls while you wield this Shield. This bonus is in addition to the Shield's normal bonus to AC.

Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a [Reaction](compendium/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to become the target of the attack instead.
