# Ball Bearings
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 1 gp
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

As a [Utilize](compendium/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can spill Ball Bearings from their pouch. They spread to cover a level, 10-foot-square area within 10 feet of yourself. A creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the [Prone](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition. It takes 10 minutes to recover the Ball Bearings.
