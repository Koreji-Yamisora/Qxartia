# Hat of Vermin
*Wondrous item, common*  


This hat has 3 charges. While holding the hat, you can take a [Magic](compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge and summon your choice of a [Bat](compendium/bestiary/beast/bat-xmm.md), a [Frog](compendium/bestiary/beast/frog-xmm.md), or a [Rat](compendium/bestiary/beast/rat-xmm.md). The summoned creature magically appears in the hat and tries to get away from you as quickly as possible. The creature is [Indifferent](compendium/rules/variant-rules/indifferent-attitude-xphb.md) toward you and other creatures, and it isn't under your control. It behaves as an ordinary creature of its kind and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). The hat regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
