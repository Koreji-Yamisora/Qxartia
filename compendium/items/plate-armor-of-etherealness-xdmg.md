- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.

While you're wearing this armor, you can take a [Magic](compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action and use a command word to gain the effect of the [Etherealness](compendium/spells/etherealness-xphb.md) spell. The spell ends immediately if you remove the armor or take a [Magic](compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to repeat the command word. This property of the armor can't be used again until the next dawn.
