# Potion of Pugilism
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

After you drink this potion, each [Unarmed Strike](compendium/rules/variant-rules/unarmed-strike-xphb.md) you make deals an extra `1d6` Force damage on a hit. This effect lasts 10 minutes.

This potion is a thick green fluid that tastes like spinach.
