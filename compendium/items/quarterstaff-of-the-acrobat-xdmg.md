*Staff, weapon ([quarterstaff](compendium/items/quarterstaff-xphb.md)), very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Range**: 30/120
- **Properties**: [Thrown](compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown), [Versatile](compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

You have a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

While holding this weapon, you can cause it to emit green [Dim Light](compendium/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) out to 10 feet, either as a [Bonus Action](compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) or after you roll [Initiative](compendium/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md), or you can extinguish the light as a [Bonus Action](compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md).

While holding this weapon, you can take a [Bonus Action](compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to alter its form, turning it into a 6-inch rod (for ease of storage) or a 10-foot pole, or reverting it a Quarterstaff; the weapon will elongate only as far as the surrounding space allows.

In certain forms, the weapon has the following additional properties.

## Acrobatic Assist (Quarterstaff and 10-Foot Pole Forms Only)

While holding this weapon, you have [Advantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity ([Acrobatics](compendium/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) checks.

## Attack Deflection (Quarterstaff Form Only)

When you are hit by an attack while holding the weapon, you can take a [Reaction](compendium/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to twirl the weapon around you, gaining a +5 bonus to your [Armor Class](compendium/rules/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb.md) against the triggering attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You can't use this property again until you finish a [Short](compendium/rules/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md) or [Long Rest](compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).

## Ranged Weapon (Quarterstaff Form Only)

This weapon has [Thrown](compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown) with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the weapon, it flies back to your hand.
