# Ring of Free Action
*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*  


While you wear this ring, [Difficult Terrain](compendium/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) doesn't cost you extra movement. In addition, magic can neither reduce any of your Speeds nor cause you to have the [Paralyzed](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) or [Restrained](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition.
