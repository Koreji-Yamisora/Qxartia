You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this sword.

You have [Advantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on the attack roll, and any damage dealt with this special attack ignores any [Immunity](compendium/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) or [Resistance](compendium/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) the target has to that damage.
