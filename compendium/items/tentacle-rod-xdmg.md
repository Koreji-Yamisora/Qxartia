# Tentacle Rod
*Rod, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This rod ends in three rubbery tentacles. While holding the rod, you can take a [Magic](compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to direct the tentacles to stretch outward, each one attacking a creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. For each tentacle, make a melee attack roll with a +9 bonus. A tentacle deals `1d6` Psychic damage on a hit. If you hit the same target with all three tentacles, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the [Restrained](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until you have the [Incapacitated](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition, until you take a [Bonus Action](compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to release the target, or until the target is no longer within 15 feet of you. While [Restrained](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) in this way, the target takes `3d6` Psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
