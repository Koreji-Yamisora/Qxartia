# Universal Solvent
*Wondrous item, legendary*  


This tube holds milky liquid with a strong alcohol smell. When found, a tube contains `1d6 + 1` ounces.

You can take a [Utilize](compendium/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action to pour 1 or more ounces of solvent from the tube onto a surface within reach. Each ounce instantly dissolves up to 1 square foot of adhesive it touches, including Sovereign Glue.
