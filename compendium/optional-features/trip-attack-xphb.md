# Trip Attack
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95*  

When you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](compendium/rules/variant-rules/unarmed-strike-xphb.md), you can expend one Superiority Die and add the die to the attack's damage roll. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the [Prone](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition.
