# Curses
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Some game effects curse a creature or an object. The effect that confers a curse defines what the curse does. Curses can be removed by the [Remove Curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse-xphb.md) and [Greater Restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration-xphb.md) spells or other magic that explicitly ends curses.
