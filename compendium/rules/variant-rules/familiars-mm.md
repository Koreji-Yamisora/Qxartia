# Familiars
*Source: Monster Manual p. 347* 

Any spellcaster that can cast the [find familiar](compendium/spells/find-familiar-xphb.md) spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the "Player's Handbook") or some other Tiny monster, such as a [crawling claw](compendium/bestiary/undead/crawling-claw-xmm.md), an [imp](compendium/bestiary/fiend/imp-xmm.md), a [pseudodragon](compendium/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon-xmm.md), or a [quasit](compendium/bestiary/fiend/quasit-xmm.md).
