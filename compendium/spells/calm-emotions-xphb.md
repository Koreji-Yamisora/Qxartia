# Calm Emotions
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each Humanoid in a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](compendium/rules/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects (choose for each creature):

- The creature has [Immunity](compendium/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to the [Charmed](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) and [Frightened](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) conditions until the spell ends. If the creature was already [Charmed](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [Frightened](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), those conditions are suppressed for the duration.  
- The creature becomes [Indifferent](compendium/rules/variant-rules/indifferent-attitude-xphb.md) about creatures of your choice that it's [Hostile](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hostile-attitude-xphb.md) toward. This indifference ends if the target takes damage or witnesses its allies taking damage. When the spell ends, the creature's attitude returns to normal.  

**Classes**: [Bard (College of Lore)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Sorcerer (Aberrant Sorcery)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-aberrant-sorcery-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Warlock (Archfey Patron)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-archfey-patron-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
