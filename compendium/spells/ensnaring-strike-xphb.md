# Ensnaring Strike
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

As you hit the target, grasping vines appear on it, and it makes a Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature has [Advantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on this save. On a failed save, the target has the [Restrained](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until the spell ends. On a successful save, the vines shrivel away, and the spell ends.

While [Restrained](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained), the target takes `1d6` Piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength ([Athletics](compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes**: [Paladin (Oath of the Ancients)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-the-ancients-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Ranger](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md)
