# Eyebite
*6th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, your eyes become an inky void. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can take a [Magic](compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to target another creature but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a save against this casting of the spell.

## Asleep

The target has the [Unconscious](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) condition. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

## Panicked

The target has the [Frightened](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition. On each of its turns, the [Frightened](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) target must take the [Dash](compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) action and move away from you by the safest and shortest route available. If the target moves to a space at least 60 feet away from you where it can't see you, this effect ends.

## Sickened

The target has the [Poisoned](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition.
