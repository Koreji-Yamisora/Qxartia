# Fire Storm
*7th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A storm of fire appears within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot Cubes, which you arrange as you like. Each [Cube](compendium/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) must be contiguous with at least one other [Cube](compendium/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `7d10` Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried start [burning](compendium/traps-hazards/burning-xphb.md).

**Classes**: [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Druid](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Sorcerer](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md)
