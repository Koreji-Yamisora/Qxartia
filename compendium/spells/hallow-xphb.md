Choose any of these creature types: Aberration, Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead. Creatures of the chosen types can't willingly enter the area, and any creature that is possessed by or that has the [Charmed](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [Frightened](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition from such creatures isn't possessed, [Charmed](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), or [Frightened](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) by them while in the area.
