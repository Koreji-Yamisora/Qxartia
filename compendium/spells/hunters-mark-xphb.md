# Hunter's Mark
*1st-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You magically mark one creature you can see within range as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra `1d6` Force damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack roll. You also have [Advantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on any Wisdom ([Perception](compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception) or [Survival](compendium/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check you make to find it.

If the target drops to 0 [Hit Points](compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) before this spell ends, you can take a [Bonus Action](compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to move the mark to a new creature you can see within range.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Your [Concentration](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) can last longer with a spell slot of level 3-4 (up to 8 hours) or 5+ (up to 24 hours).

**Classes**: [Paladin (Oath of Vengeance)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-vengeance-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Ranger](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md)
