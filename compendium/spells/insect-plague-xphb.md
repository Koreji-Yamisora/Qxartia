# Insect Plague
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a locust)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](compendium/rules/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point you choose within range. The [Sphere](compendium/rules/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) remains for the duration, and its area is [Lightly Obscured](compendium/rules/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md) and [Difficult Terrain](compendium/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md).

When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `4d10` Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d10` for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes**: [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Druid (Circle of the Land, Tropical Land)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-land-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Druid](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Sorcerer](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Warlock (Fiend Patron)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-fiend-patron-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
