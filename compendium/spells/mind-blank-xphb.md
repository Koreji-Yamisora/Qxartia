# Mind Blank
*8th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 24 hours

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has [Immunity](compendium/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Psychic damage and the [Charmed](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition. The target is also unaffected by anything that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and no spell—not even [Wish](compendium/spells/wish-xphb.md)—can gather information about the target, observe it remotely, or control its mind.

**Classes**: [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard (Abjurer)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-abjurer-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
