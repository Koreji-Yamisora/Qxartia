# Mordenkainen's Sword
*7th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature sword worth 250+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a spectral sword that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to `4d12` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

On your later turns, you can take a [Bonus Action](compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to move the sword up to 30 feet to a spot you can see and repeat the attack against the same target or a different one.

**Classes**: [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard (Evoker)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
