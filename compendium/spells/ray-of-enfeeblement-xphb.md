# Ray of Enfeeblement
*2nd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of enervating energy shoots from you toward a creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the target has [Disadvantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on the next attack roll it makes until the start of your next turn.

On a failed save, the target has [Disadvantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on Strength-based [D20 Tests](compendium/rules/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md) for the duration. During that time, it also subtracts `1d8` from all its damage rolls. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.

**Classes**: [Bard (College of Lore)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Warlock](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Wizard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
