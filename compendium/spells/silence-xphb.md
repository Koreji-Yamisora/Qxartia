# Silence
*2nd-level, Illusion (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](compendium/rules/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the [Sphere](compendium/rules/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) has [Immunity](compendium/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Thunder damage, and creatures have the [Deafened](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) condition while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a Verbal component is impossible there.

**Classes**: [Bard (College of Lore)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Ranger](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md)
