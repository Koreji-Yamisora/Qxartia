# Sunbeam
*6th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot Line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You launch a sunbeam in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long [Line](compendium/rules/variant-rules/line-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Each creature in the [Line](compendium/rules/variant-rules/line-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `6d8` Radiant damage and has the [Blinded](compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.

Until the spell ends, you can take a [Magic](compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to create a new [Line](compendium/rules/variant-rules/line-area-of-effect-xphb.md) of radiance.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines above you. It sheds [Bright Light](compendium/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 30-foot radius and [Dim Light](compendium/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.

**Classes**: [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Druid](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Sorcerer](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Wizard (Evoker)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
