# Zone of Truth
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius [Sphere](compendium/rules/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether a creature succeeds or fails on this save.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive yet must be truthful.

**Classes**: [Bard (College of Lore)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-devotion-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Paladin](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md)
