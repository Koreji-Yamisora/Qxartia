# Strong Wind
*Environmental Hazard*  

Strong wind imposes [Disadvantage](compendium/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on ranged attack rolls with weapons. It also extinguishes open flames and disperses fog. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.

A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks.
