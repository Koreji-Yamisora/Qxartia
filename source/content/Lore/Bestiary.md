_"What Survives in a Dying World"_

> Creatures adapted to [[Qxartia]] · See also: [[Entropy]] · [[The Planes]] · [[Invasion]]

## Overview

The creatures of [[Qxartia]] are shaped by the world's unique nature — a dying reality plagued by [[Entropy]], bleeding into [[The Shadowfell]] and [[The Feywild]], and invaded by beings from [[The Elemental Chaos]].

This bestiary organizes creatures by their **planar origin** and notes how [[Entropy]] affects them.
