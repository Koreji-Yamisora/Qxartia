## What the Lost Past Is

The Lost Past is not a place — it is a **condition**. It is everything that [[Entropy]] has taken: memories that have faded, beings that have been forgotten, truths that no one remembers.

In [[Qxartia]], forgetting is not passive. What is forgotten **persists** — in fragments, in echoes, in shadows of what once was.

## Forms of the Lost Past

The forgotten does not disappear. It transforms:

| Form | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [[Scriptures and Fragments]] | Texts that remember what people forgot — incomplete, contradictory, eroded |
| [[The Whispers]] | Voices in [[Kthrimvey]] that speak old memories through the trees |
| [[The Forgotten]] | Beings who have forgotten themselves — or been forgotten by the world |
| [[The Stone-Song]] | Vornesthal's pillars hum melodies no one taught them — echoes of a celestial's stillness |
| [[Borrowed Memories]] | In the Memory Groves, you can take memories that were never yours |

## Why It Matters

> *"To be forgotten is not to cease existing. It is to exist without meaning."*

The [[The Forgotten Celestials|Forgotten Celestials]] who became the continents have lost themselves to the Lost Past. They do not remember being beings of light. They are slowly forgetting being land.

When the forgetting is complete, scholars argue, one of two things will happen:
1. They will become Drifting Ones again
2. They will cease to exist entirely

## Accessing the Lost Past

Some seek out fragments of the Lost Past deliberately:

| Method | Risk |
|--------|------|
| **Memory Groves** in [[Kthrimvey]] | May absorb memories that damage your own |
| **Deep [[Miasma]]** in [[Vornesthal]] | Prolonged exposure causes forgetting |
| **Ancient Scriptures** | Contradictory — may lead to false truths |
| **The Listeners** | They interpret, but interpretation is not truth |
