## Overview

Throughout [[Qxartia]] and [[The Void]], fragments of ancient texts survive — incomplete, contradictory, and eroded by [[Entropy]]. These scriptures are the closest thing the world has to historical truth, though no two accounts agree.

> *"Truth, like memory, has eroded."*

## The Problem of Truth

No scripture agrees with another. Some describe [[Selamonius]] as benevolent; others as indifferent; others as a prison-maker. Some say three celestials were shaped; others hint at more.

> *"The more you read, the less you know. That is the nature of the [[Lost Past]]."*
