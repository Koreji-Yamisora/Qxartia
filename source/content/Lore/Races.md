## Overview

The peoples of [[Qxartia]] are diverse, each with origins tied to the planes of existence. Some trace their lineage to the [[Material Plane]] alone, while others bear the marks of [[The Feywild]], [[The Shadowfell]], [[The Elemental Chaos]], or even [[The Celestial]] before [[The Severing]].

---

## Common Races

### Humans
_"The Adaptable Ones"_

The most numerous race in Qxartia. Humans have no inherent planar connection — they are purely of the Material Plane. This makes them both unremarkable and remarkably adaptable.

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Material Plane |
| **Lifespan** | 70-90 years |
| **Traits** | Versatile, ambitious, short-lived but prolific |
| **Continent Presence** | Dominant in all three continents |

> 💡 *Humans often rise to power precisely because they have no magical heritage to rely on — they must earn everything.*

---

### Elves
_"The Fey-Touched"_

Elves carry the blood of [[The Feywild]] in their veins. Long ago, before [[The Severing]], elves crossed freely between the Material Plane and the Feywild. Now, that path is more difficult, but the connection remains.

| Subrace | Origin | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **High Elves** | Ancient Feywild settlers | Arcane magic, long memory, slightly arrogant |
| **Wood Elves** | Material Plane adapted | Swift, stealthy, deeply tied to forests |
| **Eladrin** | Pure Feywild natives | Emotions shift with seasons; rare visitors |
| **Shadar-kai** | [[The Shadowfell]] adapted | Gray-skinned, fierce, serve mysterious powers |
| **Drow** | Underdark dwellers | Dark-skinned, matriarchal, complex politics |

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Feywild / Shadowfell |
| **Lifespan** | 700+ years |
| **Traits** | Keen senses, trance meditation, resistance to charm |

---

### Dwarves
_"The Stone-Singers"_

Dwarves claim they were shaped by the primordials of [[The Elemental Chaos]] — specifically the earth primordial Grumbar. Whether true or Imperial propaganda, dwarves have an undeniable connection to stone.

| Subrace | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hill Dwarves** | Hardy, wise, close to the surface |
| **Mountain Dwarves** | Strong, martial, deep delvers |
| **Duergar** | Shadowfell-touched, gray-skinned, psionic |

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Elemental Chaos (earth) |
| **Lifespan** | 350+ years |
| **Traits** | Darkvision, poison resistance, stonecunning |
| **Continent Presence** | Strongest in [[Vornesthal]] |

---

### Halflings
_"The Lucky Folk"_

Halflings are entirely of the Material Plane — perhaps the most purely mortal of all races. They have no planar heritage, which some scholars believe makes them "invisible" to cosmic forces.

| Subrace | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Lightfoot** | Stealthy, social, wanderers |
| **Stout** | Hardy, poison-resistant, homebodies |

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Material Plane |
| **Lifespan** | 150 years |
| **Traits** | Lucky, brave, nimble |
| **Continent Presence** | Scattered everywhere, rarely in power |

---

### Orcs
_"The Fierce Ones"_

Orcs are a proud warrior race, often at odds with other civilizations. Their origins are disputed — some say they were created by a war-god of [[The Pantheon]], others that they evolved naturally in the harshest regions.

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Material Plane (possibly divine creation) |
| **Lifespan** | 50-60 years |
| **Traits** | Powerful build, aggressive, tribal society |
| **Continent Presence** | Strongest in [[Zytharkraen]] borderlands; clans scattered elsewhere |

> ⚠️ *The [[Fallen Holy Empire]] classified orcs as "monstrous" rather than a race, a prejudice that persists in some regions.*

---

### Gnomes
_"The Tinkerers"_

Gnomes are cousins to the fey, though more distant than elves. Their connection to [[The Feywild]] manifests as an affinity for illusion magic and an insatiable curiosity.

| Subrace | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Rock Gnomes** | Inventors, artificers, gadget-makers |
| **Forest Gnomes** | Illusionists, animal speakers, secretive |
| **Deep Gnomes (Svirfneblin)** | Underdark dwellers, stealthy, gemcutters |

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Feywild (distant) |
| **Lifespan** | 400+ years |
| **Traits** | Darkvision, gnome cunning (advantage vs magic) |

---

## Uncommon Races

### Tieflings
_"The Infernal-Touched"_

Tieflings carry the blood of fiends — demons from [[The Abyss]] or devils from the Nine Hells (an [[astral dominion]] that may still exist, though unconfirmed since [[The Severing]]). Their appearance marks them as outsiders.

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Abyss / Nine Hells influence |
| **Appearance** | Horns, tails, unusual skin colors |
| **Traits** | Darkvision, fire resistance, innate magic |
| **Social Status** | Feared, distrusted, often persecuted |

---

### Aasimar
_"The Celestial-Touched"_

Aasimar carry traces of celestial blood — from before [[The Severing]], when [[The Celestial]] was still connected to the mortal world. They are rare now, and their births are considered omens.

| Subrace | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Protector** | Guardian spirits, healing light |
| **Scourge** | Burning radiance, righteous fury |
| **Fallen** | Touched by darkness, inner conflict |

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Origin** | The Celestial (pre-Severing) |
| **Traits** | Darkvision, celestial resistance, healing hands |
| **Rarity** | Extremely rare since The Severing |

---

### Dragonborn
_"The Dragon-Blooded"_

Dragonborn claim descent from dragons — creatures of both the Material Plane and [[The Elemental Chaos]]. Their origins are disputed; some say they were created by dragons, others by primordials.

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Dragons / Elemental Chaos |
| **Traits** | Breath weapon, damage resistance (by ancestry) |
| **Continent Presence** | Rare everywhere; small enclaves |

---

### Half-Elves & Half-Orcs

| Race | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Half-Elves** | Human-elf hybrids; caught between worlds |
| **Half-Orcs** | Human-orc hybrids; strength and resilience |

Both are common in border regions where different peoples mix.

## The Fallen Holy Empire and Race

The [[Fallen Holy Empire]] taught that:
- **Humans** are the chosen race of [[Selamonius|God]]
- **Fey-touched races** (elves, gnomes) are "corrupted" by wild magic
- **Infernal-touched** (tieflings) are damned from birth
- **Celestial-touched** (aasimar) are holy — but suspiciously rare

This doctrine persists in some regions, creating tension between races.
