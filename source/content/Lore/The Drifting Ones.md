## What They Are

The Drifting Ones are not gods. They are **fragments** — pieces of [[The Forgotten Ones]] that remained after the First Gods faded.

Before [[Selamonius]] gave them form, they drifted between stars: formless, deathless, carrying within them dim echoes of beings too vast to comprehend.

---

## The Only Record of the First

The Drifting Ones are the **only surviving record** of [[The Forgotten Ones]].

No scripture describes the First Gods. No mortal memory contains them. But within each Drifting One — and by extension, within each continent they became — there are *instincts*. Impressions. Flickers of something older than time.

> 💡 *This is why the continents feel alive. They carry within them fragments of gods that have been forgotten even by other gods.*

---

## The Shaping

According to the oldest accounts, [[Selamonius]] took three of the Drifting Ones and pressed them into matter:

| Trait of the Fragment | Became |
|-----------------------|--------|
| **One who breathed** | [[Zytharkraen]] — the living soil, the Pulse, the endless cycle |
| **One who endured** | [[Vornesthal]] — the patient stone, the Stone-Song, the silence |
| **One who dreamed** | [[Kthrimvey]] — the whispering forest, the borrowed memories |

Each continent is a fragment of [[The Forgotten Ones]], pressed into form. Each has forgotten what it was.

---

## Why They Forgot

> *From the Canopy Scrolls of [[Kthrimvey]]:*
>
> *"To be given form is to be given* ending*. The Drifting Ones knew no time. Now, pressed into stone and root and river, they know nothing else.*
>
> *[[Entropy]] is not punishment. It is the price of* being*."*

The continents do not die — they *forget*. They forget what the Forgotten Ones were. They forget what *they* were before [[Selamonius]]. And slowly, they forget what they are now.

## Echoes That Remain

Though they have forgotten themselves, traces of their old nature linger:

| Continent       | Echo of the Drifting One                                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Zytharkraen]] | **The Pulse** — the land exhales mana at dawn, like a last breath |
| [[Vornesthal]]  | **The Stone-Song** — the pillars hum when wind passes through     |
| [[Kthrimvey]]   | **The Whispers** — trees speak fragments of forgotten memories    |

### Connection to the World Tree

Before [[The Severing]], [[The World Tree and The Severing|The World Tree]] channeled cosmic mana through the continents themselves. The Drifting Ones — now pressed into land — served as **mana conduits**:

- **The Pulse** in Zytharkraen was once continuous, not just at dawn
- **The Stone-Song** resonated with the tree's harmonic frequencies
- **The Whispers** carried messages between the mortal and divine realms

When the World Tree was severed, these echoes faded to mere remnants of their former power.

---

## The Final Forgetting

Some scholars believe that when the forgetting is complete — when the last Pulse fades, the last Stone-Song falls silent, the last Whisper dissolves into mist — the continents will become Drifting Ones again.

Others say they will simply cease to exist.

> 🌑 *"[[Qxartia]] is a world built from forgotten fragments of forgotten gods. They do not know what they were. They are slowly forgetting what they are. And when the forgetting is complete, something new will begin — or nothing at all."*
