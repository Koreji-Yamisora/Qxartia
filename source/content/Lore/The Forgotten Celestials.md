## What They Were

Before the world had weight, there were beings of pure light — formless, deathless, drifting between stars. They had no names, no edges, no endings. They simply *were*.

The old texts call them **the Unbound** or **the Drifting Ones**. Some scriptures describe them as thoughts without thinkers. Others say they were the first dreams the universe ever had.

## The Shaping

According to the oldest accounts, [[Selamonius]] — the Shaping Hand — took three of the Drifting Ones and pressed them into matter:

| Celestial Trait | Became |
|-----------------|--------|
| **One who breathed** | [[Zytharkraen]] — the living soil, the Pulse, the endless cycle |
| **One who endured** | [[Vornesthal]] — the patient stone, the Stone-Song, the silence |
| **One who dreamed** | [[Kthrimvey]] — the whispering forest, the borrowed memories |

Each continent is a celestial being, pressed into form. Each has forgotten what it was.

---

## Why They Forgot

> *From the Canopy Scrolls of [[Kthrimvey]]:*
>
> *"To be given form is to be given* ending*. The Drifting Ones knew no time. Now, pressed into stone and root and river, they know nothing else.*
>
> *[[Entropy]] is not punishment. It is the price of* being*."*

The continents do not die — they *forget*. They forget what they were before [[Selamonius]]. And slowly, they forget what they are now.

## Echoes That Remain

Though they have forgotten themselves, traces of their old nature linger:

| Continent | Echo of the Celestial |
|-----------|----------------------|
| [[Zytharkraen]] | **The Pulse** — the land exhales mana at dawn, like a last breath |
| [[Vornesthal]] | **The Stone-Song** — the pillars hum when wind passes through |
| [[Kthrimvey]] | **The Whispers** — trees speak fragments of forgotten memories |

---

## The Final Forgetting

Some scholars believe that when the forgetting is complete — when the last Pulse fades, the last Stone-Song falls silent, the last Whisper dissolves into mist — the continents will become Drifting Ones again.

Others say they will simply cease to exist.

> 🌑 *"[[Qxartia]] is a world built from forgotten gods. They do not know what they were. They are slowly forgetting what they are. And when the forgetting is complete, something new will begin — or nothing at all."*
