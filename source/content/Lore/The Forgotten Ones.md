## What Common Folk Know

**Nothing.**

No scripture speaks of them. No temple depicts them. No prayer invokes them. To the people of [[Qxartia]], the Forgotten Ones do not exist — they have been erased from all mortal record.

## What Actually Was

Before time had direction, there were the **First Gods** — beings so vast that the word "god" is merely the closest mortal approximation. They were not light. They were not darkness. They were the *possibility* of both.

They had no names because names require someone to speak them.

They had no form because form requires boundaries.

They simply *were*.

## Where the Knowledge Survives

The only record of the Forgotten Ones exists within their **fragments** — [[The Drifting Ones]].

When the Forgotten Ones faded (or were destroyed, or chose to become nothing — no account agrees), they left behind pieces of themselves: the Drifting Ones. These fragments carry within them dim echoes of what their creators were.

> 💡 *The Drifting Ones do not remember the Forgotten Ones as memories. They remember them as* instincts *— impressions of vastness, flickers of something that refuses to be named.*

## The Silence Around Them

Why do no mortal records exist?

Some theories whispered only by the most heretical scholars:

- The [[Fallen Holy Empire]] systematically destroyed all knowledge of gods before [[Selamonius|God]]
- The Forgotten Ones themselves ensured no record would survive
- Mortal minds cannot retain knowledge of them — the information simply *slips away*
