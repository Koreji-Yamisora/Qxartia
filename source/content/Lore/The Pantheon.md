## What Common Folk Know

Almost nothing — and what they think they know is **wrong**.

The [[Fallen Holy Empire]] rewrote history. Their "sacred texts" paint [[Selamonius|God]] as the one true creator, eternal and alone. The Pantheon has been reduced to myths, fairy tales, or outright heresy.

Scholars who dig too deep tend to disappear.

## What Actually Was

The Pantheon were the **second generation of gods** — born from the echoes left behind by [[The Forgotten Ones]], or perhaps shaped by them before they faded.

Unlike the Forgotten Ones, the Pantheon had:
- **Names** — though most are lost
- **Forms** — though they could wear many
- **Purposes** — each god embodied an aspect of existence

---

## The Creation of the World

The Pantheon **created the world** — not [[Selamonius]] alone.

Working together, the second generation of gods shaped reality from the fragments of [[The Forgotten Ones]] — the [[The Drifting Ones|Drifting Ones]]:

| God (Identity Lost) | What They Created |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Unknown | The **[[Material Plane]]** — mortal reality |
| Unknown | [[The Feywild]] — the bright reflection |
| Unknown | [[The Shadowfell]] — the dark reflection, realm of endings |
| Unknown | The **[[The Astral Sea|Astral Sea]]** — the realm of thought (or it always existed) |
| **[[Selamonius]]** | The shaping of [[The Drifting Ones]] into the three continents |

The **[[The Celestial|Celestial]]** was not created — it was their home, an [[astral dominion]] within the Astral Sea from which they worked.

> 💡 *This is why the [[Fallen Holy Empire]]'s lie is so dangerous. They claim [[Selamonius|God]] created everything alone. The truth is: she was one of many.*

## The Fall of the Pantheon — The Severing

The Pantheon did not last. One by one, they fell — or vanished, or were destroyed. When the last of them was gone (save [[Selamonius]]), the cosmic bonds holding the planes together **shattered**.

This cataclysm is called [[The Severing]].

### The Age Before

Before The Severing, [[The World Tree and The Severing|The World Tree]] connected the divine realms to the mortal world:

- **Ambient mana** filled the air, making magic accessible to all
- Civilizations built **mana-powered technology**: flying cities, skyships, eternal lights
- The Pantheon walked among mortals through the World Tree's branches
- Magic items were common; enchantments were trivial

### The Cataclysm

When The Severing occurred:

| Before The Severing | After The Severing |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Planes bound in a tree-like structure | Planes drift in the [[World Axis Reference|World Axis]] |
| [[The Celestial]] reachable via [[The Feywild]] | The Celestial is **severed** — no path remains |
| Elemental planes distinct | Collapsed into [[The Elemental Chaos]] |
| Divine emissaries walked among mortals | The heavens are **silent** |
| **Air saturated with mana** | **90% of ambient mana lost** |
| Flying cities, mana-engines | Crashed ruins, obsolete technology |

> *"When the Tree fell, the sky itself grew thin. The power that had sustained empires bled away like water through sand."*

## The Fake Lore

The [[Fallen Holy Empire]] created an elaborate false history:

- [[Selamonius|God]] is presented as the **only** god, eternal and uncreated
- The Pantheon are dismissed as "false idols" or "demons pretending to be divine"
- Any text mentioning other gods was burned, altered, or hidden
- Commoners are taught that questioning this is blasphemy

This false history is so deeply embedded that most people believe it without question.

---

## Where Truth Survives

Fragments of the real history exist in:

- **The Book of Forgotten Names** — fragmentary, location unknown
- **The Lithic Tablets** — buried deep in [[Vornesthal]]'s canyons
- **The Canopy Scrolls** — guarded by the Listeners of [[Kthrimvey]]
- **Oral traditions** — passed down in whispers, village to village

The [[Fallen Holy Empire]] could not destroy everything. But they came close.
