# The World Tree and The Severing

## Overview

The World Tree was an ancient cosmic entity that served as the conduit between the divine realms and the material world. Its existence fundamentally shaped the nature of magic and civilization in Qxartia.

## The Age of Abundance

### The World Tree

Before [[The Severing]], the World Tree stood at the heart of existence, its roots deep in the primordial essence and its branches reaching into the celestial planes. Through its living essence, raw mana flowed freely into the atmosphere of the mortal world.

- **Mana Saturation**: The air itself was thick with magical energy, making spellcasting effortless and powerful
- **Ambient Magic**: Even mundane objects could hold enchantments; magic permeated every aspect of life
- **Divine Connection**: The tree served as a living bridge between [[Selamonius]], [[The Pantheon]], and the mortal realms

### The Mana-Rich Era

#### Magical Technology

Civilizations flourished under the abundance of ambient mana:

- **Mana-Engines**: Devices powered purely by atmospheric magic, requiring no fuel or maintenance
- **Flying Cities**: Great metropolises that floated on currents of pure mana
- **Eternal Lights**: Self-sustaining illumination that never dimmed
- **Skyships**: Vessels that sailed through the air as easily as ships on water
- **Wardstones**: Defensive barriers that repelled threats automatically
- **Healing Fountains**: Waters infused with such potent magic they could cure any ailment

#### Society and Culture

Magic was not the domain of the gifted few, but the everyday reality of all:

- Common folk could perform simple cantrips without formal training
- Children learned to manipulate mana as naturally as learning to walk
- Architecture defied conventional physics, held aloft by ambient magical fields
- Agriculture yielded impossible harvests through mana-enriched soil
- The distinction between "caster" and "warrior" was largely meaningless—everyone had access to basic magic

## The Severing

> *"And on that day, the world tree screamed. Its roots tore from the fabric of divinity, its branches splintered across the planes. When the echoes finally faded, the gods had withdrawn—and the age of miracles was over."*
> — Fragment from the Lost Scriptures

### The Cataclysm

The exact cause of [[The Severing]] is lost to time, obscured by [[Fallen Holy Empire|false histories]] and the chaos that followed. What is known:

- The World Tree was **severed** from its divine roots
- The connection between the mortal world and the divine planes was **torn asunder**
- [[Selamonius]] and the remnants of [[The Pantheon]] withdrew to [[World Axis Reference|The Celestial]]
- Ambient mana began to **bleed away** from the atmosphere

### The Immediate Aftermath

The change was not instantaneous, but inexorable:

**First Months**:
- Mana-dependent technology began to **flicker and fail**
- Simple enchantments held, but complex workings started to unravel
- Panic spread as scholars realized the mana was not returning

**First Years**:
- Flying cities **crashed to earth**, scattering refugees across the land
- Skyships became grounded hulks of useless metal
- Eternal lights dimmed and died, plunging cities into darkness
- Food shortages as mana-enriched agriculture failed
- Civil collapse as desperate populations fought over dwindling resources

**First Decades**:
- **90% reduction** in ambient mana levels
- Only those with **innate magical talent** could still cast spells reliably
- Magical items became increasingly precious and rare
- Civilizations that had built everything on mana-technology **collapsed entirely**

## The Fall of Civilizations

### Lost Empires

Many great civilizations did not survive the transition:

#### The Aetherium Concordat
A federation of floating cities that fell from the sky when their mana-cores failed. Their ruins now dot the landscape, towering spires jutting from crater-scarred earth.

#### The Eternal Gardens
A paradise realm where death itself had been conquered through ambient healing magic. When the magic faded, centuries of forestalled mortality claimed an entire population in a single generation.

#### The Chronomancers' Collective
Masters of time manipulation, their great works required constant mana to sustain temporal stability. When the flow ceased, their cities became **time-locked ruins**—frozen moments scattered across the timeline.

### The Survivors

Only civilizations that could **adapt** survived:

- **Rediscovery of Mundane Technology**: Forges, mills, and craft that had been abandoned for millennia
- **Preservation of Knowledge**: Desperate efforts to record magical techniques before they became impossible
- **New Social Orders**: The rise of hereditary magical bloodlines and the formation of wizard academies
- **Resource Wars**: Conflicts over remaining magical artifacts and mana-rich locations

## The World Today

### Current State of Mana

The ambient mana has stabilized at a fraction of its former abundance:

- **Natural casters** (those born with The Gift) can access magic through internal reserves
- **Learned magic** requires years of study and discipline to master
- **Magic items** no longer self-replenish; they must be carefully crafted and maintained
- **Ley lines** and **mana wells** have become strategic resources, jealously guarded

### Remnants of the Old World

Scattered across Qxartia are ruins and artifacts from the Age of Abundance:

- **Inert Machines**: Technological marvels that no longer function, their secrets locked within
- **Mana Batteries**: Drained crystals that once powered cities, now sought by artificers
- **Broken Wardstones**: Crumbled defenses that hint at the power they once held
- **Floating Ruins**: Debris that still drifts on residual enchantments, defying gravity
- **Sealed Vaults**: Treasure rooms and libraries protected by magic that still holds—barely

### The Search for Solutions

Various factions pursue different paths:

- **The Restoration**: Those who seek to **reforge the World Tree** and restore the old world
- **The Acceptance**: Scholars who believe adaptation is the only path forward
- **The Ascendants**: Cultists who seek to **become divine** themselves to fill the void left by the gods
- **The Seekers**: Archaeologists and adventurers who delve into ruins seeking lost knowledge

## Connections

- [[Selamonius]]: The last of The Pantheon, who withdrew during The Severing
- [[The Pantheon]]: The second-generation gods whose connection to the mortal world was severed
- [[The Forgotten Ones]]: The first-generation deities whose fate is even more mysterious
- [[Fallen Holy Empire]]: Propagates false histories about The Severing to maintain control
- [[World Axis Reference]]: The planar structure that was fundamentally altered by The Severing

*This lore is part of the **True History** known to scholars and those who delve deep enough into the ruins of the past. The common folk believe the [[Fallen Holy Empire|Church's teachings]] that magic has always been rare and the current age is the natural order.*
