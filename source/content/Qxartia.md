# Qxartia
_A world of forgotten gods and slow forgetting_

---

## Overview

Qxartia is a world of three supercontinents shaped by ancient forces and the slow, inevitable process of [[Entropy]].

- **Genre**: Brutal and tragic
- **Core Theme**: Entropy and [[Invasion]] — entropy is slow, natural decay; invasion is entropy's quiet expansion
- **Escape Route**: Those fleeing Qxartia's decay often seek refuge in [[The Void]], particularly [[The Four Axel]]

---

## The Continents

Qxartia's three supercontinents are [[The Forgotten Celestials]] — beings of light pressed into form by [[Selamonius]], the Shaping Hand.

| Continent | Title | Celestial Trait |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| [[Zytharkraen]] | "The Earth That Breathes" | One who breathed |
| [[Vornesthal]] | "The Stone-Song Plains" | One who endured |
| [[Kthrimvey]] | "The Whispering Woods" | One who dreamed |

---

## Core Systems

- [[Entropy]] — The slow forgetting that shapes all of Qxartia
- [[Mana]] — The purple, translucent particles that fuel magic
- [[Invasion]] — Entities that feed on the world's weakening defenses

## Cosmology

The **[[World Axis Reference|World Axis]]** describes the structure of the planes:

| Category | Planes |
|----------|--------|
| **Prime** | [[Material Plane]] (Qxartia) |
| **Fundamental** | [[The Astral Sea]] (above) · [[The Elemental Chaos]] (below) |
| **Parallel** | [[The Feywild]] (bright) · [[The Shadowfell]] (dark) |
| **Dominions** | [[The Celestial]] (severed) |
| **Elemental Realms** | [[The Abyss]] |
| **Anomalous** | [[The Void]] · [[The Four Axel]] |

This structure emerged after [[The Severing]] — the cataclysm when [[The Pantheon]] fell.

## Quick Reference

| Continent | Entropy Effect | Magic Trait |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| [[Zytharkraen]] | Soil loses nutrients | [[Mana]] flows fast, decays fast |
| [[Vornesthal]] | Stones slowly dissolve | [[Mana]] is rare and slow |
| [[Kthrimvey]] | Trees grow then vanish | [[Mana]] cycles through living things |

> 🌑 *Final Truth*: **Qxartia is a world built from forgotten gods. They do not know what they were. They are slowly forgetting what they are.**
