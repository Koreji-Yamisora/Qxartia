## What Entropy Is

Entropy in [[Qxartia]] is not destruction — it is **slow forgetting**.

Everything in this world gradually loses its sharp edges:
- Trees grow fast, then vanish
- Rivers run backward in places
- Magic fades after use, like a candle that burns out without a flame
- *No one can stop it*, but those who understand it can learn to live with it

> 💡 *Key Insight*: **Everything remembers what it was, but forgets how to be.**

## Why Entropy Exists

> *From the Canopy Scrolls of [[Kthrimvey]]:*
>
> *"To be given form is to be given ending. [[The Drifting Ones]] knew no time. Now, pressed into stone and root and river, they know nothing else.*
>
> *Entropy is not punishment. It is the price of being."*

When [[Selamonius]] shaped the formless celestials into continents, it gave them **edges** and **endings**. Entropy is the slow erosion of those edges — the continents forgetting what they are.

## The Severing and Entropy

Some scholars believe that [[Entropy]]'s acceleration began with [[The Severing]] — the cataclysm when [[The Pantheon]] fell and the planes restructured.

Before the Severing, the planes were bound together in a stable structure. When those bonds shattered, the cosmic wound left behind began to bleed — and that bleeding is Entropy.

> 🌑 *"The Severing is the wound. Entropy is the blood. Qxartia is dying of an injury it cannot remember receiving."*

## Entropy and the Parallel Planes

### [[The Shadowfell]]
The Shadowfell is the **dark reflection** of the Material Plane. Where Entropy concentrates, the boundary to the Shadowfell thins — the two planes begin to bleed together.

| Symptom | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| Gray, washed-out colors | Shadowfell bleeding through |
| Sounds becoming muffled | Planar boundary thinning |
| Sense of cold despair | Shadowfell's nature manifesting |
| Undead rising | Souls unable to pass through properly |

> ⚠️ *The severe symptoms of Entropy zones are not caused by Entropy itself — they are the manifestation of the Shadowfell into the Material Plane.*

### [[The Feywild]]
The Feywild is the **bright reflection** — an amplified version of the Material Plane. In areas where Entropy is *low*, the Feywild bleeds through instead:

| Symptom | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| Vivid, oversaturated colors | Feywild influence |
| Time distortion | Feywild's fluid time |
| Wild magic surges | Raw fey energy crossing over |
| Appearance of fey creatures | Boundary thinning |

## Types of Entropy

Entropy is not one force — it wears **many faces**, each manifesting in localized regions across all continents:

| Type | What Forgets | Common Regions |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Temporal** | Time flows unevenly | Near ancient ruins, ley line intersections |
| **Material** | Physical matter erodes | River valleys, mining tunnels, old battlefields |
| **Memory** | Minds and identity fade | Dense fog banks, cursed villages, places of great tragedy |
| **Vital** | Life force drains | Swamps, dying forests, places where celestials fell |
| **Arcane** | Magic decays faster | Near [[Miasma]] pools, overused ritual sites |
| **Sensory** | Perception distorts | Deep caves, twilight groves, places between borders |

> 💡 *A single village may experience Memory entropy while the forest beside it suffers Vital entropy.*

## Regional Manifestations

Entropy concentrates in **pockets**, not borders. The same continent can hold regions untouched for centuries beside places where everything forgets within hours.

### Temporal Entropy Zones
- Ruins where a day passes like a week
- Crossroads where travelers arrive before they left
- Gardens where flowers bloom and die in a single breath

### Material Entropy Zones
- Stone walls that crumble into sand overnight
- Rivers that dissolve metal but leave wood untouched
- Roads that must be rebuilt every season

### Memory Entropy Zones
- Villages where elders forget their grandchildren's names
- Libraries where ink fades from the page as you read
- Battlefields where the dead forget they've fallen

### Vital Entropy Zones
- Forests where trees grow tall then collapse into rot
- Farms where crops sprout gray and tasteless
- Ponds where fish swim slower each day until they stop

### Arcane Entropy Zones
- Ritual sites where spells unravel mid-casting
- [[Mana]] wells that drain faster than they fill
- Enchanted objects that lose their glow within hours

### Sensory Entropy Zones
- Caves where echoes arrive before the sound
- Mists where north feels like south
- Twilight groves where colors bleed into gray

## Entropy and Magic

See [[Mana]] for full details. Key effects:

- Magic used in decaying lands fades **2x faster**
- [[Miasma]] in [[Vornesthal]] becomes dull gray instead of vibrant purple
- Magic stones left unused for 1 week lose 30% glow
- A spell cast in [[Zytharkraen]] may work for 48 hours, but in [[Kthrimvey]] only 12 hours

---

## The Final Forgetting

Some believe that when entropy is complete — when the continents fully forget what they are — they will either:
1. Become [[The Drifting Ones|Drifting Ones]] again
2. Cease to exist entirely

> 🌑 *"Qxartia doesn't end — it remembers itself, one forgotten piece at a time."*
