## What Mana Is

Mana is a **purple, translucent particle** in the air — visible when concentrated. Like oxygen, creatures' blood can carry magic alongside what they need for living.

> The more purple the blood, the more mana that creature can store for casting.

## Natural Flow

```
Plants → absorb sunlight → convert to Mana → store in roots/leaves
    ↓
  Soil: fungi absorb mana → convert to Miasma → used by creatures
    ↓
Sacred trees: release stored mana when touched
    (but [[Entropy]] causes them to fade after 1 use)
```

## Mana by Region

Mana behaves differently based on local conditions — not continental borders:

| Region Type | Mana Behavior |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Pulse Vents** (fertile lands) | Flows fast and freely; decays faster; spells last 1-2 days |
| **Fungal Caves** | Rare and slow; must be harvested from roots; stones last up to 3 weeks |
| **Ancient Forests** | Organic and cyclical; closed loop through plants/soil/fungi |
| **Entropy Zones** | Mana behaves unpredictably; see [[Entropy]] for regional effects |

## Magic Stones

Materials like magic stones can store and gather mana from the air:

| Condition              | Effect                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Left unused for 1 week | 30% less glow                                   |
| Used daily             | 50% less glow in 3 days                         |
| In [[Vornesthal]]      | Lasts longer (up to 3 weeks) but absorbs slowly |
| In [[Zytharkraen]]     | Absorbs quickly but loses charge in 1 week      |

## Pacts and Oaths

People who make deals or oaths with higher beings — or trade with them for magic — effectively combine their magical capacity with the being's. This is like borrowing blood.

Such beings may come from:
- [[The Feywild]] — Archfey and fey lords
- [[The Abyss]] — Demon lords (dangerous, corrupting)
- [[The Astral Sea]] — Rare celestial entities (if any remain)
- [[The Elemental Chaos]] — Primordials and genies

## Entropy Effects on Magic

[[Entropy]] makes magic **temporary — not weak, but fleeting**. Effects depend on the local entropy type:

| Entropy Type | Effect on Magic |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Arcane** | Spells unravel mid-casting; enchanted objects lose glow within hours |
| **Vital** | [[Miasma]] becomes dull gray instead of vibrant purple; life-based magic fades 2x faster |
| **Temporal** | Spell durations become unpredictable — 48 hours or 12 hours at random |
| **Memory** | Casters sometimes forget incantations mid-spell |
