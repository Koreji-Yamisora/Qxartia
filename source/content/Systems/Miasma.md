## What Miasma Is

Miasma is the **decayed form of mana** — what remains after [[Mana]] has been processed, used, or forgotten. Where mana is vibrant purple, miasma is **dull gray** or **pale violet**, like a candle's smoke after the flame has died.

## How Miasma Forms

```
Plants absorb sunlight → convert to Mana → store in roots/leaves
                              ↓
         Fungi absorb mana → convert to Miasma → rises as faint mist
```

In healthy lands, this cycle is balanced. But where [[Entropy]] takes hold, miasma becomes **thick**, **stagnant**, and **oppressive**.

## Miasma and the Lost Past

In places where miasma grows thick, the [[Lost Past]] seeps through. Old memories, dead voices, and echoes of forgotten things rise with the mist. Some seek these places deliberately; most avoid them.

> *"Breathe the gray mist long enough, and you'll remember things that never happened to you."*
