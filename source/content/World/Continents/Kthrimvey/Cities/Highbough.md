# Highbough
_Capital of the Canopy Courts_

> Part of [[Canopy Courts]] · [[Kthrimvey]] · [[Qxartia]] · [[Elder Canopy]]

## Overview

Highbough is built across seven colossal trees whose crowns have grown together over millennia — a city in the sky where the ground is a distant, shameful memory. Palaces of woven wood and captured starlight connect via living bridges. The View from Highbough is legendary; so is its residents' refusal to look down.
