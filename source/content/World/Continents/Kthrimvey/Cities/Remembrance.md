# Remembrance
_Sacred Capital of the Grove Keepers_

> Part of [[Grove Keepers]] · [[Kthrimvey]] · [[Qxartia]] · [[Memory Groves]]

## Overview

Remembrance is less a city than a **sacred settlement** — monasteries, libraries, and pilgrim hostels scattered among the oldest Memory Grove. No building exceeds sapling height. Paths are marked by [[Mana]]-lanterns. The silence is profound but never empty.

## The Full Moon

At full moon, the entire grove glows from the roots — accumulated [[Mana]] rising through ancient wood. Pilgrims report hearing voices of the long-dead. Keepers translate what they can.

## Landmarks

- **The Root-Tongue's Chamber**: Oldest tree; where the leader communes
- **The Archive of Sorrows**: Records of all grief-memories given to the grove
- **The Speaking Stones**: Where tree-whispers are transcribed
