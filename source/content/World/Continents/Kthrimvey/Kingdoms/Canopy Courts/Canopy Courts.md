# The Canopy Courts
_"Those who dwell below simply haven't earned the sky."_

## Overview

In the uppermost reaches of [[Kthrimvey]]'s impossibly tall forests, where the trees form a second sky and the ground is nothing but a distant legend, the **Canopy Courts** have built an aristocratic civilization of breathtaking beauty and casual cruelty.

Connected by bridges of living vine and engineered branch, the Courts are a network of treetop estates, each ruled by a noble house that has lived above the clouds for so long that they have forgotten — or chosen to ignore — everything below.

---

## The High Houses

The Canopy Courts are ruled by twelve **High Houses**, each claiming a different region of the Elder Canopy:

| House | Domain | Specialty |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **House Verdance** | The Sunward Reaches | Diplomacy, trade |
| **House Thornspire** | The Needle Woods | Military, defense |
| **House Mistweave** | The Cloud-Touch Heights | Magic, scholarship |
| **House Goldleaf** | The Amber Groves | Wealth, banking |
| **House Whisperwind** | The Singing Boughs | Music, art, culture |
| **House Rootsever** | Border estates | "Security" (severing bridges to the ground) |

> *The other six Houses are considered "Lesser" — close enough to the ground to be an embarrassment.*

---

## Governance: The Canopy Concord

The Courts are governed by the **Canopy Concord**, a parliament of noble representatives:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Sky-Regent** | Ceremonial head, rotates between Great Houses yearly |
| **Voice of the Canopy** | Actual decision-maker, elected by secret ballot |
| **Bridge-Masters** | Control travel between estates |
| **Ground-Wardens** | Manage (exploit) relations with those below |

---

## Capital: Highbough

See [[Highbough]] for full details.

The crown jewel of the Canopy Courts — a city built across seven massive trees whose crowns have grown together over millennia. Palaces of woven wood and captured starlight. Gardens where flowers bloom in impossible colors. And below it all, a thousand-foot drop into the darkness of the Root-Sea.

The View from Highbough is legendary. So is its residents' refusal to look down.

---

## Culture

The Canopy Courts value:

| Value | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Height** | Social status literally correlates with altitude |
| **Elegance** | Art, music, poetry are currency |
| **Detachment** | Emotional restraint is aristocratic; passion is "groundish" |
| **Memory** | They claim to remember what others forget — but choose what to remember |

### The Descent Taboo

Willingly going to the forest floor is social death. Those who descend and return are called **Groundlings** — technically still citizens, practically untouchable.

> *"She walked on soil. Can you imagine? Actual soil, touching her feet. We had to burn her shoes."*

---

## Economy

The Courts trade in luxury:

| Export | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Canopy Silk** | Fabric that shimmers like dawn light |
| **Sky Honey** | From bees that never descend |
| **Preserved Art** | Protected from Entropy by altitude (they claim) |
| **Patronage** | Nobles sponsor artists, scholars — for a price |

| Import | Source |
|--------|--------|
| **Food** | From [[Root-Sea Nomads]] — paid poorly, expected regularly |
| **Servants** | From the ground, of course |
| **Mana-Goods** | [[Grove Keepers]] provide; Courts pretend they don't need it |

## The View and The Forgotten

The Canopy Courts deliberately don't look down. This is not just snobbery — it's theological. They believe that looking toward the ground invites [[Entropy]]:

> *"The [[Mist Hollows]] rise. The Root-Sea swallows. The ground forgets. We remember because we do not look."*

Some scholars suggest this is why the Courts record history so meticulously — they are terrified of the slow forgetting that consumes everything below.

---

## Military: The Thornguard

The Courts maintain an aerial defense force:

| Unit | Role |
|------|------|
| **Thornguard** | Elite house soldiers |
| **Sky-Archers** | Long-range specialists |
| **Bridge-Cutters** | Can sever connections in emergencies |
| **Mist-Walkers** | Scouts who dare enter the Hollows (considered mad) |

---

## Relations with Other Powers

| Power | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| [[Root-Sea Nomads]] | Exploitation disguised as trade |
| [[Grove Keepers]] | Reluctant respect — the Keepers have something they need |
| [[Pulse-Keepers]] | Consider them peasants with pretensions |
| [[Veinian Oligarchy]] | "Farmers. Respectable farmers, but farmers." |
