# Vornesthal
_"The Stone-Song Plains"_

> Part of [[Qxartia]] · One of the [[The Drifting Ones|Drifting Ones]] · Shaped by [[Selamonius]]

## Overview

Vornesthal is a continent of silence and endurance — a vast, windswept plateau of rust-red stone, towering spires, and labyrinthine canyons that swallow sound whole. Where [[Zytharkraen]] breathes with life, Vornesthal **holds its breath**. The land is ancient, dry, and weathered, and those who live here have learned to survive on very little.

## Geography

### The Singing Pillars
Towering columns of pale stone, some reaching heights of a quarter-league, scattered across the central plains like the ribs of a buried giant. When the wind passes through them, they emit a low, droning hum — the **Stone-Song**. No two pillar fields produce the same note; some harmonize, some dissonant. Travelers learn to navigate by sound.

### The Carved Canyons
Vast networks of canyons wind beneath the surface, their walls etched with patterns that predate all known civilizations. Some believe the patterns are the **last thoughts** of something ancient, frozen in stone. The canyons are sacred — and dangerous.

### The Fungal Underdark
Below the surface lies a network of caves where **mana-fungi** grow in luminous clusters. These fungi absorb ambient [[Mana]] and release it in slow, rhythmic pulses — like a heartbeat in reverse. The glow is purple-white, and the air is thick with spores. Communities of **Deep-Dwellers** have made their homes here for millennia.

### The Salt Flats of Karveth
The eastern edge of Vornesthal, where the land has dried into cracked white plains. Nothing grows here. The wind carries a faint metallic taste. Old songs say this is where something **wept itself dry** — and the salt is crystallized grief.

## Magic & Entropy

Magic in Vornesthal is **rare** and **slow**. [[Mana]] does not flow freely here — it must be coaxed from fungal roots and carefully stored. See [[Entropy]] for the full taxonomy of Qxartia's slow forgetting.

### Regional Entropy Zones

| Region | Entropy Type | Effect |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **The Carved Canyons** | [[Entropy#Material\|Material]] | Stone walls dissolve over centuries; some pillar fields have vanished entirely; tools lose sharpness within a week |
| **The Fungal Underdark** | [[Entropy#Sensory\|Sensory]] | Echoes arrive before sounds; directions feel reversed; prolonged exposure causes disorientation and lethargy |
| **The Salt Flats of Karveth** | [[Entropy#Memory\|Memory]] | Travelers forget why they came; old songs say this land wept itself dry and the salt is crystallized grief |
| **Ancient Pillar Fields** | [[Entropy#Temporal\|Temporal]] | Time flows unevenly near the oldest pillars; moments stretch or compress without warning |

## Culture & People

The people of Vornesthal are **stoic**, **deliberate**, and **deeply communal**. Resources are scarce, and survival depends on cooperation. Most settlements are built into canyon walls or within the Fungal Underdark.

**The Listeners** — a priestly caste — dedicate their lives to interpreting the Stone-Song. They believe the pillars carry messages from something older than memory.

**Common sayings**:
- *"A stone speaks once in a lifetime. Listen well."*
- *"The canyon knows your footsteps."*
- *"We do not rush. The dead have eternity."*

## The Forgotten Celestial

> *From the Lithic Tablets, plate 3 — chiseled into the walls of the Deepest Canyon:*
>
> *"There was one among the drifting lights who did not move. It hung between stars like a held breath — patient, unyielding, silent. It knew no joy. It knew no sorrow. It simply* endured.
>
> *When [[Selamonius]] came to shape the formless, this one did not resist. It did not weep. It allowed itself to be* pressed *— flattened into stone, stretched into canyon, hollowed into cave.*
>
> *The Stone-Song is its only voice now. It does not cry out. It hums. It waits. It remembers* nothing*, and so it does not grieve."*

> *From the Requiem of Still Things, sung by Listeners during the Long Silence:*
>
> *"Shaped by the Hand that broke the stars,  
> Pressed into weight, into edge, into ending,  
> You who held your breath for eons —  
> We hear you. We hear you. We hear you still."*
