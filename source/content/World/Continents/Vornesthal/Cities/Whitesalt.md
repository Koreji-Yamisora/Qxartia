## Overview

Whitesalt is a city of white stone on white ground beneath pale skies — a study in monochrome wealth. The Salt Lords build upward to escape the endless flatness, and visitors say the city *crunches* underfoot. At night, moonlight reflects off the flats with such intensity that the city glows.
