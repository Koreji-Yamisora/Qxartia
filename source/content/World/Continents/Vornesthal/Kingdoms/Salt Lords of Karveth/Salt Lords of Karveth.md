# The Salt Lords of Karveth
_"Everything has a price. Even grief."_

> Part of [[Vornesthal]] · [[Qxartia]] · [[Salt Flats of Karveth]]

## Overview

On the eastern edge of [[Vornesthal]], where the land has cried itself dry, lies the **Salt Flats of Karveth** — a cracked white expanse where nothing grows and the wind carries a faint metallic taste. Here, merchant-princes called the **Salt Lords** have built an empire not on conquest, but on monopoly.

They control the only reliable source of **preservation salt** in [[Qxartia]] — a substance that slows [[Entropy]] in stored goods. In a world where everything decays, that makes them indispensable.

## The Salt Lords

The Salt Lords are not nobility by blood but by wealth. Anyone can become a Salt Lord — if they can buy in:

| Title | Requirements |
|-------|--------------|
| **Salt Lord** | Own at least 100 salt-acres |
| **Brine Baron** | Own 10-99 salt-acres |
| **Crystal Merchant** | Trade salt without owning land |
| **Dust-Walker** | Harvest salt for wages |

> *"The only aristocracy is solvency."* — Lord Kethros Whitehand

## Governance: The Salt Conclave

The Salt Lords govern through the **Salt Conclave** in **Whitesalt**, their capital:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **High Salter** | Elected leader (3-year term, bought through donations) |
| **Price-Keepers** | Set salt prices across Qxartia |
| **Brine Guard** | Military and enforcement |
| **Grief-Collectors** | Manage the... unique source of Karveth salt |

---

## Capital: Whitesalt

See [[Whitesalt]] for full details.

A city of white stone on white ground beneath white skies. The Salt Lords build upward to escape the endless flatness — towers and spires competing for height. The streets are paved with salt-crystal, and visitors report that the city *crunches* underfoot.

At night, moonlight reflects off the flats with such intensity that Whitesalt glows.

## The Origin of the Salt

Ancient songs say the Salt Flats are **crystallized grief**:

> *From the Requiem of Still Things: "And when the Shaping was complete, and the Celestial understood what it had become, it wept. Not blood. Not water. Something older. The tears turned to salt before they touched the ground. They are still falling, somewhere the eye cannot see."*

The Salt Lords officially consider this "poetic metaphor." Privately, their Grief-Collectors perform certain rituals to ensure the salt keeps forming.

## Products

The Salt Lords sell more than just salt:

| Product | Use | Price |
|---------|-----|-------|
| **Preservation Salt** | Slows Entropy in food, goods | Standard |
| **Mourner's Crystal** | Pure salt for magical preservation | High |
| **Tear-Essence** | Liquid extracted from raw salt; alchemical uses | Very high |
| **Memory Salt** | Rumored to preserve memories when consumed | Legendary |

> *The difference between a Veinian bushel lasting one week versus one month is just salt. That week could mean the difference between profit and famine. The Salt Lords know this.*

## Economy

| Income | Source |
|--------|--------|
| **Salt Trade** | Primary — every kingdom needs preservation salt |
| **Shipping** | Control of salt caravans and routes |
| **Banking** | Salt is stable; many use it as currency backing |
| **Information** | Caravans hear things; the Salt Lords know things |

| Expenses |
|----------|
| Bribing the [[Stone-Singer Confederation]] for passage rights |
| Paying mercenaries to protect caravans |
| "Gifts" to the [[Veinian Oligarchy]] to maintain trade agreements |

### The Weeping

A dark secret: some believe the salt replenishes through **emotional extraction**. The Salt Lords maintain "Mourning Houses" where the grief-stricken can sell their sorrow. The more intense the grief, the purer the salt.

This is illegal on paper. It is extremely profitable in practice.

## Military: The Brine Guard

The Salt Lords maintain a professional army:

| Unit | Role |
|------|------|
| **Crystal Knights** | Heavy cavalry with salt-hardened armor |
| **Caravan Shields** | Escort and protection forces |
| **White Blades** | Assassins who leave salt crystals on their victims |
| **Grief-Collectors** | Officially "ritual specialists." Unofficially... |

## Relations with Other Powers

| Power | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| [[Stone-Singer Confederation]] | Pay tolls, maintain roads, mutual need |
| [[Deep-Dweller Clans]] | Competition — both sell preservatives |
| [[Veinian Oligarchy]] | Strongest trade partner — they need salt most |
| [[Marsh Wardens]] | Supply salt to slow Entropy effects; distant respect |
