_Capital of the Marsh Wardens_

> Part of [[Marsh Wardens]] · [[Zytharkraen]] · [[Qxartia]] · Border of the [[Hollow Marshes]]

## Overview

Hollowmarch is a city on stilts — literally and metaphorically. Every structure is designed to be dismantled and moved when the [[Entropy]] line advances. The air smells of peat and strange flowers. Newcomers report persistent déjà vu; long-time residents sometimes forget why they came.

## Districts

| District | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Command Heights** | Warden-General's headquarters; highest point |
| **The Palisades** | Defensive perimeter; always manned |
| **Remembrancer Row** | Where memories are recorded before lost |
| **The Traveler's Rest** | Inns, taverns, mercenary quarters |
| **Returner's Hospice** | Where the memory-lost are cared for |

## The Movable City

Hollowmarch has relocated three times in the past century. Buildings are:
- Prefabricated with modular joints
- Light enough for organized transport
- Never more than two stories tall

## Landmarks

- **The Anchor Stone**: A massive mana-marker; the city's symbolic heart
- **The Wall of Names**: Those who walked into the Marshes and never returned
- **The Forgetting Garden**: Where Returners sit in peaceful confusion
