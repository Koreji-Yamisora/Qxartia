# The Marsh Wardens
_"We hold the line where memory ends."_

## Overview

The Marsh Wardens are the grim guardians of Zytharkraen's southern border — the [[Hollow Marshes]], where [[Entropy]] has advanced so far that the land itself has begun to forget how to exist. They are soldiers, researchers, and, in their own words, *the last sane people standing at the edge of unbecoming*.

This is not a kingdom of prosperity. It is a kingdom of **purpose**.

## The Warden's Oath

Every Marsh Warden speaks the oath upon initiation:

> *"I will remember for those who have forgotten.*
> *I will stand where the land gives way.*
> *When the mist takes me, I will still hold the line."*

Those who serve long enough in the Marshes begin to forget fragments of their own past — names, faces, childhood memories. They accept this as the price of duty.

## Leadership: The Warden-General

The Marsh Wardens are a **military meritocracy**:

| Rank | Role |
|------|------|
| **Warden-General** | Supreme commander, elected by senior officers |
| **Hollow-Commanders** | Lead expeditions into entropy zones |
| **Border-Captains** | Defend the perimeter settlements |
| **Marsh-Scouts** | Cartographers who map the ever-shifting boundary |
| **Remembrancers** | Record what the Wardens forget — their personal memories |

## Capital: Hollowmarch

See [[Hollowmarch]] for full details.

Built on stilts above the unstable border, Hollowmarch is a city of impermanence. Buildings are designed to be dismantled and moved when the entropy line advances. The air smells of peat and strange flowers that bloom once and dissolve. Newcomers report a persistent feeling of *déjà vu* — or its opposite.

## The Hollow Marshes

The southern region of Zytharkraen where Entropy has won:

| Phenomenon | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Memory Fog** | Mist that causes temporary amnesia |
| **Forgetting Trees** | Trees that stand skeletal, roots disconnected from purpose |
| **The Silence** | Zones where sound no longer travels |
| **Returners** | People who enter and "forget how to leave" — sometimes seen wandering |

> *The Marshes don't kill you. They just make you forget that you're alive.*

## The War Against Forgetting

The Marsh Wardens fight a war without enemies:

### Active Measures
- **Anchor Stones**: Mana-infused markers that slow entropy's advance (temporary)
- **Memory Stakes**: Personal artifacts buried at the border to "remind" the land what it was
- **Controlled Burns**: Setting fire to heavily-affected areas to prevent spread

### Research
- Studying why some individuals resist entropy better than others
- Developing **Recall Elixirs** — potions that restore lost memories (unreliable, expensive)
- Mapping the boundary's movement to predict future advances

## Economy

The Marsh Wardens survive on:

| Income | Source |
|--------|--------|
| **Subsidies** | The [[Veinian Oligarchy]] pays them to hold the line |
| **Expedition Salvage** | Artifacts recovered from forgotten ruins |
| **Rare Materials** | Entropy-touched plants with unique alchemical properties |
| **Desperate Labor** | Those fleeing debt sometimes volunteer for dangerous duty |

> *You can always tell a Marsh Warden in a tavern. They're the ones who forgot the first half of every story they try to tell.*

---

## The Returners

The Wardens' greatest tragedy — and mystery — are the Returners: people who wandered too deep into the Marshes and came back... changed. They move, they eat, they respond to stimuli. But they have forgotten *who they are*. Some Returners wander for years before collapsing. A few have been recognized by family.

The Wardens maintain a **Returner Hospice** in Hollowmarch. It is the saddest building in Zytharkraen.

## Relations with Other Powers

| Power | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| [[Veinian Oligarchy]] | Employers — they pay for protection they take for granted |
| [[Pulse-Keepers]] | Send chaplains, but their prayers don't work as well near the Marshes |
| [[Fading Blades]] | Mercenary company that often works alongside Wardens |
| [[Stone-Singer Confederation]] | Interested in Warden research on entropy |

---

## The Warden's Creed

Those who serve long enough compose their own version:

> *I forgot my mother's name today.*
> *But I remembered why I stand here.*
> *That will have to be enough.*
