## What Common Folk Believe (The Fallen Holy Empire's Version)

> *The official doctrine taught in temples and schools across [[Qxartia]]:*

The Abyss is where [[Selamonius|God]] sends the wicked. It is a place of **divine punishment** — the unworthy suffer, the sinful are purged, and the damned are consumed. Demons and devils exist as instruments of judgment, torturing those who defied God's will.

Good souls go to rest in God's embrace. Bad souls go to the Abyss.

> 🔥 *"Live righteously, or the Abyss awaits. God sees all, judges all, and forgets nothing."*
> — Common funeral blessing

The [[Fallen Holy Empire]] conflates the Abyss with [[The Shadowfell]], teaching that all dark afterlives are "the Abyss" to simplify their theology of fear.

## What Actually Exists (The Hidden Truth)

> *Forbidden knowledge, preserved in hidden texts:*

The Abyss is an **[[elemental realm]]** — a domain within [[The Elemental Chaos]] that has been claimed by demonic forces. It is not a creation of [[The Pantheon]], nor is it where souls go after death.

The Abyss predates mortal history. Some scholars believe it formed when [[The Severing]] caused the elemental planes to collapse into the Elemental Chaos — a wound in reality where the darkest energies pooled. Others believe it has always existed, a pit of corruption at the lowest point of creation.

| Common Belief | Reality |
|---------------|--------|
| The Abyss is the afterlife for sinners | Souls go to [[The Shadowfell]], not the Abyss |
| God created it for punishment | It predates or emerged independently of divine will |
| Demons are divine instruments | Demons are chaotic beings of the Elemental Chaos |

> 💡 *The Fallen Holy Empire deliberately conflates the Abyss with the Shadowfell to simplify their theology — "be good or burn." The truth is more complex and more terrifying.*

## What It Is

The Abyss is a **multi-layered pit** at the lowest point of [[The Elemental Chaos]] — an infinite descent into ever-more-chaotic and corrupted layers. Each layer is its own realm, ruled by demon lords who war endlessly for supremacy.

It is **not** the afterlife. It is not where souls go. It is a realm of pure chaos and malevolence.

## The Infinite Layers

The Abyss is not one place but many — a potentially infinite stack of layers, each more terrible than the last:

| Layer | Ruler | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Pazunia** (1st) | None (contested) | The Plain of Infinite Portals — gateway to deeper layers |
| **Azzagrat** | Graz'zt | Triple realm of the Dark Prince |
| **The Demonweb Pits** | [[Lolth]] | Spider-goddess's domain of woven planar matter |
| **The Endless Maze** | Baphomet | Labyrinth of the demon lord of beasts |
| *Countless others* | Various demon lords | Layers beyond mortal knowledge |

> 💀 *Some scholars claim there are 666 layers. Others say infinite. None have counted and lived.*

## What Dwells There

The Abyss is not empty. It has its own inhabitants:

### Demons

Beings of corruption and chaos, born from the darkest aspects of existence:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Balor** | Towering lords of flame and shadow, generals of demon armies |
| **Marilith** | Six-armed serpentine warriors, cunning and deadly |
| **Vrock** | Vulture-demons that revel in carnage |
| **Glabrezu** | Tempters who offer power for terrible prices |
| **Hezrou** | Toad-like demons of brute strength and poison |
| **Shadow Demons** | Incorporeal stalkers that feed on fear |

### Devils

Where demons are chaos, devils are **order** — cruel, calculating, bound by contracts:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Pit Fiends** | Rulers of infernal legions, masters of war |
| **Erinyes** | Fallen celestials, now hunters of the damned |
| **Ice Devils** | Cold strategists who command through fear |
| **Bone Devils** | Interrogators and torturers, patient and precise |
| **Imps** | Spies and tempters, seeking souls to corrupt |

### Other Inhabitants

| Being | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Liches** | Undead sorcerers who traded their souls for immortality |
| **Wraiths** | Souls twisted by hatred, echoes of lives ended in rage |
| **Night Hags** | Traders in souls and nightmares, crossing between planes |
| **Yugoloths** | Mercenaries of the lower planes, loyal only to payment |

## The Emerging Understanding (After the Empire)

> *New scholarship developing since the [[Fallen Holy Empire]]'s collapse:*

With the Empire gone, warlocks, scholars, and desperate souls have begun negotiating with the denizens of the Abyss directly. A new understanding is forming:

- Demons are **chaotic but not mindless** — some can be reasoned with
- Devils follow **strict contracts** — their word is binding, if treacherous
- The Abyss is not divine punishment — it is simply **another ecosystem**
- Souls may not *suffer* there so much as... change

> 🔮 *"The Empire told us the Abyss was God's prison. But prisons have wardens. Who is the warden of the Abyss? No one. It is a wilderness, not a dungeon."*
> — Modern demonologist

## What Demons and Devils Remember

**Almost nothing.**

The demons and devils born in the last age have no memory of [[The Pantheon]] or the Abyss's original purpose. They believe this is simply what the Abyss is — what it has always been.

| Generation | What They Know |
|------------|----------------|
| **Ancient Demon Lords** | May remember the corruption, but see it as their *birth*, not a fall |
| **Elder Devils** | Preserve contracts from before the severing, but the context is lost |
| **Younger Fiends** | Nothing — chaos and torment is all they've ever known |

The oldest devils keep meticulous records — but even they don't understand what came before. The contracts reference entities and agreements that no longer make sense.

> 💀 *The Pit Fiend Karzeth possesses a contract signed by a name no demon recognizes. The terms: "Stewardship of the resting souls." He has no idea what it means.*

## Reaching the Abyss

The Abyss is difficult to reach — and that is by design:

- **Planar rifts** — [[The Severing]] left cracks in reality; some lead to the Chaos
- **Summoning circles** — Warlocks and cultists open portals for demon lords
- **The Elemental Chaos** — Travel deep enough into the Chaos, and you spiral down
- **Certain caves** — The deepest places may break through to the pit

Most who enter the Abyss do not leave. Those who do are rarely unchanged.
