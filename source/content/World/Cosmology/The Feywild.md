## What Common Folk Believe (The Fallen Holy Empire's Version)

> *The official doctrine taught in temples and schools across [[Qxartia]]:*

The Feywild is a **cursed reflection** of the world — a place where creatures rejected by [[Selamonius|God]] were banished. The fey are tricksters and deceivers, remnants of a time before God brought order. They are to be avoided, never trusted, and certainly never bargained with.

The Feywild exists because God's light cannot reach everywhere. In the shadows of creation, strange things grew.

> ⚠️ *"Beware the fairy ring. What dwells beyond serves no god, knows no law, and speaks only lies."*
> — Temple teaching to children

## What Is Actually True (The Pantheon's Creation)

> *Forbidden knowledge, preserved in hidden texts:*

The Feywild was shaped by one of [[The Pantheon]] — not [[Selamonius]], but another god whose name has been erased.

It is **not** a place of corruption. It is a **parallel creation** — the world reflected through the lens of wild magic and unbridled emotion. Where the Material Plane was shaped for stability, the Feywild was shaped for *possibility*.

The Fey are not fallen creatures. They are the **original inhabitants** of this plane, shaped by the same Pantheon god who made their home. The Archfey may be the last beings who remember which god created them — but they do not speak of it.

> 💡 *The Fallen Holy Empire erased this god from history because the Feywild proves Selamonius was not alone.*

---

## What It Is

The Feywild is a **reflection** of the Material Plane — occupying the same locations but in a different dimension. Where [[Zytharkraen]] has a forest, the Feywild has a forest too — but stranger, wilder, more *alive*.

Colors are brighter. Emotions are sharper. Time flows differently. The Feywild is reality with its edges sharpened and its inhibitions removed.

---

## The Same Place, Different Reality

The Feywild mirrors the geography of [[Qxartia]]:

| Material Plane | Feywild Reflection |
|----------------|-------------------|
| The Breathing Forests of [[Zytharkraen]] | The Ever-Bloom — flowers that sing and trees that walk |
| The Carved Canyons of [[Vornesthal]] | The Crystal Ravines — stone that hums with color |
| The Mist Hollows of [[Kthrimvey]] | The Dreaming Fens — mists that show futures and pasts |

> 💡 *Cross over in a village, and you'll find yourself in the Feywild's version of that village — often uninhabited, sometimes occupied by things that look almost like the people you know.*

## The Fey Races

The Feywild is home to the **Fey** — beings of magic, emotion, and ancient power:

| Race | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Eladrin** | Elves native to the Feywild, their appearance shifts with their emotions and the seasons |
| **Satyrs** | Revelers and tricksters, goat-legged beings of music and mischief |
| **Pixies** | Tiny winged sprites capable of powerful illusion magic |
| **Sprites** | Fierce guardians of the wilds, able to read hearts |
| **Dryads** | Spirits bound to trees, protective and territorial |
| **Centaurs** | Noble warriors and guardians of the deep wild |
| **Firbolgs** | Gentle giants who tend the forests and speak to beasts |
| **Hags** | Ancient and terrible — bargain-makers who deal in debts and dreams |

The Archfey — godlike rulers — command vast courts:
- **The Summer Court** — passion, growth, warmth
- **The Winter Court** — sleep, stillness, cold beauty
- **The Gloaming Court** — twilight, secrets, the in-between

## The Emerging Understanding (After the Empire)

> *New scholarship developing since the [[Fallen Holy Empire]]'s collapse:*

With the Empire's grip loosened, scholars and travelers have begun to learn from the Fey directly. A new understanding is forming — neither the Empire's fear-mongering nor the ancient truth:

- Fey are **complex beings** — neither wholly good nor wholly evil
- Bargains with Fey follow **their own logic**, not mortal morality
- The Feywild operates on **emotional truth**, not factual truth
- Commerce and alliance with Fey courts is possible, if dangerous

> 🌿 *"They are not demons. They are not angels. They are something else entirely — and the Empire's refusal to understand them cost us centuries of knowledge."*
> — Modern naturalist studying the Feywild

## What the Fey Themselves Remember

**Very little.**

The newer generations of Fey — those born in the last thousand years — have no memory of [[The Pantheon]] or the god who created their realm. Like mortals, their history has been **lost through time**.

| Generation | What They Know |
|------------|----------------|
| **The Archfey** | May remember fragments, but do not speak of it |
| **Elder Fey** (1000+ years) | Vague impressions, half-remembered songs |
| **Younger Fey** | Nothing — they believe the Feywild has always been |

The Fey do not record history the way mortals do. They live in an eternal present, where yesterday's events feel as distant as events from a millennium ago.

> 💭 *Ask a young eladrin who made the Feywild, and they will laugh. "It was always here," they'll say. "It always will be."*

---

## Passageway to the Celestial

The Feywild was once the **bridge** to [[The Celestial]] — the realm where [[The Pantheon]] dwelt.

Mortals could not reach the Celestial directly. They had to pass through the Feywild first — navigating its dangers and earning passage. The Archfey served as gatekeepers.

> ⚠️ *This path is now closed. With the Pantheon gone — all save [[Selamonius]] — the connection to the Celestial has been severed. The Feywild leads nowhere divine anymore.*

---

## Crossing Over

Boundaries between the Material Plane and the Feywild are thin in certain places:

- **Fairy rings** — circles of mushrooms or standing stones
- **At twilight** — the moments between day and night
- **Where magic concentrates** — near [[Mana]] wells and ancient ruins
- **During the solstices** — when the veil is thinnest

Travelers who cross over often lose track of time. A night in the Feywild might be a year in the mortal world — or the reverse.
