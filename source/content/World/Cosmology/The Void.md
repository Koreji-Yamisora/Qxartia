# The Void
_"The Space Between" · "The Liminal Infinity"_

## What It Is

The Void is not part of the [[World Axis Reference|World Axis]]. It exists **outside** — a place **in between each alternate universe**, a liminal space where the rules of existence bend and blur.

While the World Axis describes the planes connected to [[Qxartia]] (the Material Plane, the Astral Sea, the Elemental Chaos, and their contents), the Void is something else entirely — the space between *all* realities.

## Properties

| Aspect | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Time Dilation** | 1 hour here = 1 minute in the real world |
| **Purpose** | A place to rest, to escape, to observe |
| **Alternate Selves** | You may see versions of yourself from other realities walking around |

> *"Trust me, you will see lots of the rulers' alternate selves walking around and doing their work."*

## Places Within The Void

The Void is not empty — it contains its own geography:

### [[The Four Axel]]
A continent within The Void, composed of four kingdoms in conflict:
- [[Darkness Kingdom]]
- [[Light Kingdom]]
- [[Dream Kingdom]]
- [[Hope Kingdom]]

---

## Why People Come Here

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Rest** | Time moves slower — recover without losing days |
| **Refuge** | Escape from [[Invasion]] and [[Entropy]] |
| **Observation** | Watch alternate realities unfold |
| **The Migration** | Many have abandoned their dying worlds to live here permanently |

---

## The Migration

Due to the depletion of resources caused by [[Entropy]] and [[Invasion]], many have chosen to abandon their worlds and escape to The Void. Some settle in places like [[The Four Axel]]; others drift endlessly.
