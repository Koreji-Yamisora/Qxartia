## Why Descriptive Adjectives Matter

Descriptive adjectives are the secret sauce that transforms flat writing into vivid prose. They tell readers:
- **What kind?** — "the *ancient* tower"
- **Which one?** — "the *crimson* cloak"
- **How many?** — "the *countless* stars"

> **Key Rule**: Like seasoning—use sparingly. One perfect adjective beats three mediocre ones.

## How Adjectives Affect Tone

| **Romance** | tender, radiant, alluring, intimate |
| **Action** | explosive, frenzied, merciless, relentless |
| **Literary** | wistful, melancholic, introspective, ethereal |
