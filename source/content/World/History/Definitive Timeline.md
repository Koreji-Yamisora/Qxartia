## Era of Formlessness (Before Time)

- [[The Forgotten Celestials]] drift between stars — beings of light without form, death, or memory

## The Age of Shaping (~Year 0)

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **The First Pressing** | Selamonius gives form to the first Celestial → becomes [[Zytharkraen]] |
| **The Second Pressing** | Another Celestial accepts form → becomes [[Vornesthal]] |
| **The Third Pressing** | The last Celestial is shaped → becomes [[Kthrimvey]] |
| **The First Breath** | Zytharkraen exhales for the first time → the [[Pulse-Keepers]] call this Year 0 |
| **Selamonius Withdraws** | The Shaping Hand departs or transforms; no further record |

## Major Wars

### [[The War of Borders]] (~1000-1100)

The first continental war — fought over the [[Veinian Heartlands]]' fertile territory as [[Entropy]] began claiming outer regions. Ended with the First Accords, which established current kingdom boundaries.

### [[The Entropy Schism]] (~1500-1600)

A theological and military conflict over how to respond to [[Entropy]]:
- **Activists** (led by Marsh Wardens, Salt Lords) wanted aggressive counter-measures
- **Accepters** (led by Grove Keepers, some Pulse-Keepers) believed entropy should be accepted as natural

The Schism split families, kingdoms, and religions. Its wounds are still healing.

### [[The Second Border War]] (~1600-1700)

A continuation of the Schism; territory changed hands multiple times. Ended with the **Entropy Accords** — a treaty requiring all kingdoms to contribute to the [[Marsh Wardens]]' defense.
