## The First Song: Before the Pillars Sang

*In the time before sound,*
*When the stars were just light,*
*The Shaping Hand came*
*And pressed us to ground.*

*But we did not weep.*
*We did not resist.*
*We opened our mouths*
*And the Stone-Song began.*

> The Confederation teaches that Vornesthal's Celestial did not resist the Shaping but *chose* to become stone — and its acceptance gave it voice when others received only silence.

---

## The Second Song: The Five Tones

*Bassvorn rumbles deep,*
*The foundation of all things.*
*Keening Hollow wails high,*
*The warning of storms.*

*Harmoneth holds the center,*
*Where balance lives.*
*Dissonai clashes loud,*
*Where truth fights itself.*

*And Silenthold speaks nothing,*
*Which says everything.*

> The tribes do not consider this hierarchy; all notes are equal. The Silenthold controversy involves whether "nothing" is truly a note — or the absence of one.

## The Third Song: The War of Borders

*They came from the Heartlands,*
*Hungry for stone.*
*They came from the Canopy,*
*Looking for roads.*

*We did not attack them.*
*We never attack.*
*We simply stood still*
*And the pillars sang back.*

*The Stone-Song warned them:*
*"You walk wrong paths."*
*They would not listen.*
*They paid the cost.*

> The Confederation claims complete defensive action during the War of Borders. Other accounts suggest more active resistance. The Songs do not mention the Silent Canyon Siege specifically.

---

## The Fourth Song: The Schism Question

*They asked: "Do we fight the fading?"*
*We asked: "What does the Stone say?"*
*The pillars hummed low and high,*
*Both resistance and release.*

*So we took no side.*
*We never take sides.*
*We listen. We translate.*
*We let others decide.*

> The Stone-Singer Confederation officially remained neutral during the Entropy Schism, though individual tribes joined both factions. This neutrality has been criticized as "convenient indecision."

---

## The Fifth Song: The Silenthold Question

*Once there were six tribal notes.*
*Now the sixth is still.*
*Did Entropy take the voice?*
*Or did the voice choose silence?*

*The Silenthold say: "Listen closer."*
*The others say: "There's nothing to hear."*
*Perhaps both are right.*
*Perhaps both are wrong.*

*The pillars will tell us—*
*When they're ready.*

> This is the most recent addition to the Songs, composed within the last century. The Silenthold Schism remains unresolved. Some verses have been censored by Chorus Council order.

## Translator's Note

The Stone-Songs are not meant to be read but *heard*. Their musical notation carries emotional weight that text cannot convey. The Bassvorn version sounds like inevitability; the Keening Hollow version sounds like mourning. Both are the same words.

We apologize for the inadequacy of translation.
