# The Veinian Chronicles
_Official History of the Veinian Oligarchy_

> ⚠️ **READER WARNING**: This document represents the official position of the [[Veinian Oligarchy]]. It contains significant bias and should be read critically.

## Preamble

*The following history is maintained by the House of Goldsoil on behalf of the Seven Great Houses. It represents the true and accurate account of our people's glorious past.*

---

## The Sacred Soil

From the first moment [[Selamonius]] pressed form into light, the land that would become our Heartlands was **chosen**. The soil was richest here. The [[Pulse]] was strongest here. This was no accident.

> *"We were given the burden of feeding the world. It is a burden we carry with pride."*
> — Founder's Creed, attributed to First Harvest-Lord Veran I

## Our Enemies' Jealousy

Throughout history, lesser kingdoms have coveted what we have earned:

### The War of Borders
The [[Stone-Singer Confederation]] and [[Canopy Courts]] attacked our eastern farms without provocation. They claimed they were "desperate" from [[Entropy]]. We say: if they had worked as hard as we did, they would not have been desperate.

We defended ourselves. We won. The First Accords recognized our territory.

### The Entropy Schism
The [[Grove Keepers]] and [[Pulse-Keepers]] told us to "accept" the decay that was eating our crops. Easy words from those who don't depend on harvest. We funded the [[Marsh Wardens]] while philosophers debated. We saved the frontier while others prayed.

## The Truth About Harvest Servitude

Foreign critics call it "slavery." This is slander.

**Harvest Servitude** is a contractual arrangement:
- A farmer borrows against future crops
- If crops fail (due to [[Entropy]], not personal failure), they work to repay
- Terms are fair and regulated by House Goldsoil
- Servants receive housing, food, and dignity

> *"We do not enslave. We provide structure for those who could not structure themselves."*
> — Current Tithe-Master's statement

The so-called "reformers" who criticize this system have never managed a farm in their lives.

## Our Contributions

The Veinian Oligarchy provides:
- 60% of [[Qxartia]]'s grain
- 40% of all preserved food (using [[Salt Lords of Karveth|Salt Lord]] preservation)
- Employment for millions
- The single largest contribution to [[Marsh Wardens]] funding

Without us, the world starves. They would do well to remember this.

---

## The Future

The Seven Great Houses will continue to lead, to feed, and to prosper. Those who work hard will rise. Those who don't will find their place.

*Glory to the Harvest. Glory to the Houses. Glory to the Soil.*
