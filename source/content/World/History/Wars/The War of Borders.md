# The War of Borders
_The First Continental War_

> Part of [[Definitive Timeline]] · Years ~1000-1100 · See also: [[Entropy]]

## Overview

The War of Borders was the first major conflict to engulf all three supercontinents of [[Qxartia]]. What began as territorial disputes in [[Zytharkraen]] — as [[Entropy]] claimed outer farmland — escalated into a hundred-year war that reshaped political boundaries and established the kingdom system that exists today.

---

## Causes

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Entropy Pressure** | Outer farmlands became unproductive; populations pushed inward |
| **Resource Competition** | The fertile [[Veinian Heartlands]] became contested territory |
| **Trade Collapse** | Salt trade routes disrupted as borders shifted |
| **Religious Disputes** | [[Pulse-Keepers]] vs [[Grove Keepers]] over whose interpretation was correct |

---

## Major Battles

| Battle | Location | Outcome |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **The Harvest Burning** | Veinian Heartlands | Thornweald burns rivals' crops — mutual devastation |
| **The Silent Canyon Siege** | Vornesthal | Stone-Singers hold against Salt Lord expansion |
| **The Canopy Fall** | Kthrimvey | Root-Sea Nomads cut bridges; Canopy Court estates collapse |
| **The Pulse of Blood** | Breathlight | Pulse-Keeper schism as clergy takes sides |

## Kingdom Perspectives

Each kingdom remembers this war differently:

### [[Veinian Oligarchy]] View
> *"We defended our sacred soil against envious neighbors. The war was imposed upon us by those who could not grow their own food."*

### [[Stone-Singer Confederation]] View
> *"The pillars sang warnings for decades. We alone listened. The war was a punishment for those who ignored the Stone-Song."*

### [[Canopy Courts]] View
> *"The groundlings rose above their station. We merely reminded them of the natural order — height determining worth."*

### [[Marsh Wardens]] View
> *"While they fought over land, the Marshes advanced. We remember. We always remember what was lost while others argued."*

## The First Accords

The war ended with the **First Accords** — a treaty that:
- Established current kingdom boundaries
- Created the [[Marsh Wardens]] as a neutral border force
- Required all kingdoms to contribute to Entropy defense
- Established trade routes and customs (later managed by [[Salt Lords of Karveth|Salt Lords]])

---

## Legacy

The War of Borders left deep scars:
- Ethnic tensions between regions persist
- Old alliances and grudges influence modern politics
- The Accords themselves are increasingly questioned
- Some historians argue the war never truly ended — just paused
