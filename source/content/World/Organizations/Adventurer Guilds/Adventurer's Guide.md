# Adventurer's Guide to Qxartia
_Practical advice for surviving a decaying world_

> Published by the Inter-Guild Council · Updated annually · DO NOT ENTER ENTROPY ZONES WITHOUT PROPER TRAINING

---

## Part I: General Survival

### Rule #1: Everything Decays

This is not metaphor. This is fact.

- Your rations will spoil faster than you expect
- Your enchanted items will lose charge
- Your memories — yes, your memories — can fade in certain areas

**Always carry more supplies than you think you need.**

---

### Rule #2: Know Your Continent

| Continent | Primary Threat | Essential Gear |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| [[Zytharkraen]] | Rapid decay, memory loss near Marshes | Extra rations, memory journal, [[Preservation Salt]] |
| [[Vornesthal]] | Hostile terrain, sound disorientation | Climbing gear, ear protection, light sources |
| [[Kthrimvey]] | Disorientation, hostile forest, traps | Compass (magical), guide contract, offerings |

---

### Rule #3: Respect Local Authority

Even if you disagree with them.

- [[Pulse-Keepers]] control casting schedules — break their rules at your own risk
- [[Canopy Courts]] despise ground-dwellers — don't give them excuses
- [[Salt Lords of Karveth]] own the preservation market — you need them more than they need you

---

## Part II: Region-Specific Guides

### Surviving the Hollow Marshes

> ⚠️ **DANGER LEVEL: EXTREME** — Do not enter without [[Marsh Warden]] authorization

**Before You Go:**
- File a Memory Record with [[Hollowmarch]] Remembrancers
- Memorize your name, birthplace, and quest objective
- Carry personal mementos that trigger strong memories

**While Inside:**
- NEVER stop moving for more than 1 hour
- If you feel confusion, check your journal immediately
- If you forget why you're there, LEAVE
- Returners are not enemies — they're warnings

**Signs of Memory Decay:**
1. You can't remember the previous day's meals
2. Familiar names sound wrong
3. You feel like you've been walking for days (even if it's been hours)
4. You feel peaceful about staying (THIS IS DANGEROUS)

---

### Navigating the Singing Pillars

> ⚠️ **DANGER LEVEL: MODERATE** — Hire a [[Stone-Singer Confederation]] guide

**Before You Go:**
- Learn the five tribal tones (Bassvorn, Keening Hollow, Harmoneth, Dissonai, Silenthold)
- Understand that navigation is BY SOUND, not sight
- Prepare for dissonant days (no travel recommended)

**While Inside:**
- Follow the harmony — dissonance means wrong path
- If all sound stops, you've entered Silenthold territory (proceed with caution)
- Pillar-dust is valuable but harvesting is regulated — ask permission

**Warning Signs:**
- Ringing in ears that doesn't stop
- Inability to distinguish notes
- Compulsion to touch pillars (don't)

---

### The Root-Sea and Mist Hollows

> ⚠️ **DANGER LEVEL: HIGH** — [[Root-Sea Nomads]] guide REQUIRED

**Before You Go:**
- Contract with a Drift-Band or Anchor-Band
- Accept that you may encounter ruins with valuable goods — these are TRAPS
- Prepare offerings for the forest (ask your guide what's appropriate)

**While Inside:**
- The floor is not solid — follow your guide's exact footsteps
- If mist rolls in, STOP MOVING
- Voices in the mist are not friends or enemies — they're echoes
- Never descend into ruins without multiple anchor lines

**The Mist Hollows Specifically:**
- Sound doesn't behave normally — don't trust echo direction
- You may hear your own voice speaking words you haven't said
- [[Grove Keepers]] sometimes enter the Hollows for rituals — don't interrupt

---

### Trading with the Salt Lords

> ⚠️ **DANGER LEVEL: FINANCIAL** — Read all contracts carefully

**Before You Go:**
- Establish credit with a Crystal Merchant
- Know current salt-weight exchange rates
- Understand that "negotiation" means something different in [[Whitesalt]]

**While Trading:**
- Everything is for sale — including things that shouldn't be
- Mourning Houses are real — don't let debt get out of control
- The Grief Merchants are legitimate — don't give them reasons to visit

**Avoiding Debt Traps:**
- Never borrow against future income
- Read contracts THREE times before signing
- "Flexible terms" is a warning phrase

---

### Dealing with the Canopy Courts

> ⚠️ **DANGER LEVEL: SOCIAL** — Altitude determines everything

**Before You Go:**
- If possible, enter through official channels with aristocratic sponsorship
- Learn the Twelve High Houses and their current politics
- Prepare for condescension — it's not personal, it's cultural

**While Present:**
- NEVER look down in public (it's rude)
- NEVER discuss the ground in positive terms
- NEVER ask about Groundlings
- Acknowledge that elevation = worth (even if you disagree)

**If Things Go Wrong:**
- Descend immediately — they won't follow
- Contact [[Root-Sea Nomads]] for extraction
- Accept that you've become a Groundling in their eyes

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Memory loss symptoms | Read journal, say your name aloud, retreat |
| Lost in Pillar Fields | Stop, listen, follow the clearest harmony |

## Final Reminder

> *Qxartia decays. You will decay with it, eventually. The question is: what will you accomplish before then?*
