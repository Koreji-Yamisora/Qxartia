# Vamulor
_The City of Knowledge_

> Part of [[Darkness Kingdom]] · [[The Four Axel]] · [[The Void]]

---

## Overview

Vamulor is the **city of knowledge** within the [[Darkness Kingdom]] — a haven for historians, lecturers, and scholars seeking to complete their research. While the Darkness Kingdom may be known for shadows and secrets, Vamulor hoards something far more valuable: **information**.

## The National Library

At the heart of Vamulor stands the **National Library** — a vast repository containing:

- Every useful document the kingdom has collected
- Every *not-so-useful* document as well
- Ancient texts, forbidden knowledge, and mundane records alike

> *If it was ever written down, Vamulor probably has a copy.*

The Library serves as the intellectual center of the [[Darkness Kingdom]], drawing scholars from across [[The Four Axel]] despite the kingdom's reputation.
