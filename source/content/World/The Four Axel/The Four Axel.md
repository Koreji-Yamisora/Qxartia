# The Four Axel
_"So pick a side… It's going to be one hell of a story"_

> A continent within [[The Void]] · See also: [[Mana]]

## Overview

The Four Axel is one of the continents within [[The Void]] — the liminal space between Alternate Universes. Unlike [[Qxartia]], which exists within the [[World Axis Reference|World Axis]], The Four Axel floats in the space-between, where time moves slower and the boundaries of self blur.

This continent consists of **four kingdoms**, each embodying a different aspect of existence:

| Kingdom | Domain |
|---------|--------|
| [[Darkness Kingdom]] | Shadow, secrets, and the weight of past sins |
| [[Light Kingdom]] | *Details to come* |
| [[Dream Kingdom]] | *Details to come* |
| [[Hope Kingdom]] | *Details to come* |

---

## Current Conflict

The four kingdoms exist in a state of **fragile tension**. Disagreements have erupted among the rulers over the actions of the **former leader of the Darkness Kingdom** — sins of the past that still poison the present.

Alliances are forming. Lines are being drawn.

## Magic in The Four Axel

The Four Axel uses the same [[Mana]] system as the wider multiverse:

- **Mana** appears as purple, translucent particles in the air
- Creatures carry magic in their **blood** — the more purple the blood, the more mana capacity
- **Magic stones** can store and gather mana from the air
- **Pacts with higher beings** combine your magical capacity with theirs

## The Void's Effect

Because The Four Axel exists within [[The Void]]:

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Time Dilation** | 1 hour here = 1 minute in the real world |
| **Alternate Selves** | You may encounter alternate versions of yourself — many rulers have seen their own alternates walking the streets |
| **Refuge** | Many use The Void (and The Four Axel) as a place to rest and recover |

## The Kingdoms

### [[Darkness Kingdom]]
Led by a young ruler rumored to be a tyrant who made a pact with one of the **7 Demon Lords**. The land is perpetually gloomy, as if rain is always about to fall. Seven cities comprise this kingdom, with the island of **Vainglory** serving as a prison for the worst criminals.

### [[Light Kingdom]]
*To be expanded*

### [[Dream Kingdom]]

## Connection to Qxartia

The Four Axel has a deep and growing relationship with [[Qxartia]]:

### The Great Migration

As [[Entropy]] and [[Invasion]] ravage Qxartia, many have fled through [[The Void]] to seek refuge in The Four Axel. These refugees bring:

| What They Bring | Effect on The Four Axel |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Knowledge** | Scholars share lore of [[The Severing]], the planes, and lost magic |
| **Trade goods** | Rare materials from [[Zytharkraen]], [[Vornesthal]], [[Kthrimvey]] |
| **Conflict** | Old grudges and kingdom rivalries follow the refugees |
| **Desperation** | Some will do anything for safety — including dark bargains |

### Alternate Selves

Because The Void touches many realities, **alternate versions of Qxartian individuals** sometimes appear in The Four Axel:

- A merchant from [[Veinia Prime]] might meet a version of themselves who became a warlord
- Rulers of The Four Axel reportedly see their alternates regularly
- Some believe the **Darkness Kingdom's young tyrant** may be an alternate version of someone from Qxartia's history

### Portals and Passages

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Void Rifts** | Rare tears in reality, often near [[Entropy]] zones |
| **The Dream Kingdom's Gates** | Said to open to those who truly wish to escape |
| **Death's Edge** | Some who nearly die in Qxartia wake in The Void instead |
| **Deliberate Magic** | Powerful mages can force passage, but it is exhausting and dangerous |
