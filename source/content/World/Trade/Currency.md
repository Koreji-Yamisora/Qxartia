_"What Still Has Value in a Dying World"_

## Overview

Currency in [[Qxartia]] is complicated by [[Entropy]] — coins can tarnish, paper can fade, and even the concept of "value" becomes unstable in regions where memory decays.

Different continents have developed different solutions.

## Standard Coinage

Most trade uses a **metal currency system** based on D&D standards:

| Coin | Metal | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Copper piece (cp)** | Copper | 1 cp | Common use, daily purchases |
| **Silver piece (sp)** | Silver | 10 cp | Standard trade |
| **Electrum piece (ep)** | Electrum | 50 cp | Rare, distrusted in some regions |
| **Gold piece (gp)** | Gold | 100 cp | Major purchases, contracts |
| **Platinum piece (pp)** | Platinum | 1,000 cp | Rare, used for large transactions |

### Entropy Effects on Coins
| Entropy Type | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| **Material** | Coins corrode faster; copper becomes worthless |
| **Memory** | People forget the value of coins; barter replaces trade |
| **Temporal** | New coins age rapidly; old coins sometimes "refresh" |

## Continental Currencies

### [[Zytharkraen]] — Pulse Coins

In the land of the Pulse, currency incorporates [[Mana]]:

| Currency        | Description                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Breath-Mark** | Copper coins stamped during the morning Pulse   |
| **Vein-Silver** | Silver coins with trace mana crystallization    |
| **Heartgold**   | Gold coins that faintly glow with absorbed mana |

> 💡 *Heartgold coins are prized because they resist Arcane Entropy — the mana protects the metal.*

### [[Vornesthal]] — Stone Tokens

Dwarven and stone-singer influence means currency is heavy but durable:

| Currency | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Chip** | Small carved stone tokens (equivalent to copper) |
| **Shard** | Polished semi-precious stones |
| **Core** | Dense metal coins, often alloyed with rare earth |

> 💡 *Vornesthal currency is nearly immune to Material Entropy — but worthless in Memory Entropy zones where no one remembers what it's worth.*

### [[Kthrimvey]] — Memory Leaves

The Whispering Woods use an unusual system:

| Currency | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Whisper-Leaf** | Preserved leaves that hold a sung memory |
| **Root-Mark** | Carved tokens from sacred trees |
| **Dream-Seed** | Seeds of rare plants — value fluctuates with regrowth |

> ⚠️ *Memory Leaves lose value in Memory Entropy zones — the preserved memories fade, leaving blank leaves.*

## Alternative Value Systems

### Barter
In Entropy-heavy regions, barter dominates:
- Food is always valuable
- Clean water more precious than gold
- Mana stones serve as universal currency
- Services traded for services

### [[Mana]] Crystals
In all continents, mana stones can serve as currency:

| Grade | Description | Value (approximate) |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Dull** | Nearly depleted | 1-5 gp |
| **Dim** | Low charge | 10-25 gp |
| **Bright** | Standard charge | 50-100 gp |
| **Radiant** | High capacity | 200-500 gp |
| **Perfect** | Flawless, full | 1,000+ gp |

> 💎 *Mana crystals are the closest thing to universal currency — they have practical value everywhere.*

### Favors and Debts
Especially in [[Kthrimvey]] and among fey-influenced cultures, **favors** have value:
- A debt owed is currency that can be traded
- Names carry weight — a promise from a noble is worth gold
- Fey bargains form their own economy

## Banking and Trade Guilds

### The Pulse-Runners Guild
Based in [[Zytharkraen]], handles currency exchange and mana-backed loans.

### Stone-Vaults of Vornesthal
Dwarven banking — slow, reliable, heavily guarded. Will store valuables for centuries.

### The Mist-Traders
[[Kthrimvey]] traders who deal in exotic goods and memory-preserved items.

### The Void Merchants
Those who trade with refugees from [[The Four Axel]] — dealing in goods from other realities.
